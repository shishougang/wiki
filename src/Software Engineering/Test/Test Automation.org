** 记录和回放方式
*** Benefits
+ Very easy and fast to create initially
+ No programming skill needed

*** Problems
+ Does not test anything unless checkpoints added
+ Very fragile
  1. Often single change in UI can break all tests
+ Hard to maintain
  1. Plenty of separate test scripts
  2. No modularity or reuse
+ System must be ready before automation can start
  1. Does not support acceptance test driven development(ATDD)
*** Summary
+ Seldom a good approach in general
+ Never a good basis for large scale automation

** 线性脚本
*** Benefits
+ Fast to create initially
+ Flexible
+ Can use common scripting languages
  1. No license costs
*** Problems
+ Creating tests requires programming skills
+ Very fragile
  1. One change in the system may break all scripts
+ Hard to maintain
  1. Plenty of test scripts
  2. No modularity or reuse
*** Summary
+ Adequate for simple tasks
+ Never a good basis for large scale automation
** 模块化脚本
*** Benefits
+ Reuse of code
  1. Creating new tests gets faster
+ Maintainability
  1. Changes requires fixes in smaller areas
+ Driver scripts are simple
  1. Even novice programmers can understand and edit
  2. Creating new ones is not hard either
*** Problems
+ Building test library requires initial effort
  1. Takes time
  2. Requires programming skills
+ Test data embedded into scripts
  1. Requires some understanding of programming
+ New tests require new driver scripts
*** Summary
+ Good for simple tasks
+ Works also in large usage /if/ everyone who need to understand
  tests can program
+ Not good for non-programmers

** 数据驱动测试
*** Benefits
+ Test libraries provide modularity
  1. Same benefits as with modular scripting
+ Creating and editing existing tests is very easy
  1. No programming skills needed
+ Maintenance responsibilities can be divided
  1. Testers are responsible for the test data
  2. Programmers are responsible for automation code
*** Problems
+ Test cases are similar 
  1. For example '1 + 2 = 3' and '1 * 2 = 2'
+ New kinds of tests need new driver script
  1. For example '1 * 2 + 3 = 6'
  2. Creating driver scripts requires programming skills
+ Initial effort creating parsers and other reusable components can
  be big
*** Summary
+ Good solution even for larger scale use
+ New kinds of tests requiring programming is a minus
+ May be an overkill for simple tests
** 关键字驱动测试
*** Benefits
+ All smae benefits as with data-driven testing
  1. Non-programming can create and edit tests
  2. Separation of test data and code
+ Tests can be constructed freely from keywords
  1. Non-programmers can create also new kinds of tests
  2. With suitable keywords also data-driven tests possible
+ All tests can be executed by one framework
  1. No need to create and maintain separate driver scripts
*** Problems
+ Initial effort can be really big
  1. But there are open source solutions available
*** Summary
+ Very good solution for large scale use
+ Use exiting solutions if you can
+ May be an overkill for simple needs
