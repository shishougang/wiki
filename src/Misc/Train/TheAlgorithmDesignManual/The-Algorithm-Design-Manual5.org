** 5.1 Flavors of Graphs
+ Undirected vs. Directed
+ Weighted vs. Unweighted
+ Simple vs. Non-simple
+ Sparse vs. Dense
+ Cyclic vs. Acyclic
+ Embedded vs. Topological
+ Implicit vs. Explicit
+ Labeled vs. Unlabeled

** 5.2 Data Structures for Graphs
+ Adjacency Matrix: We can represent G using an n×n matrix M, where
  element M[i, j] = 1 if(i, j) is an edge of G, and 0 if it isn’t.
+ Adjacency Lists: We can more efficiently represent sparse graphs by
  using linked lists to store the neighbors adjacent to each vertex.

Adjacency lists are the right data structure for most applications of
graphs.

*Adjacency Lists*

#+begin_src c++
#define MAXV 1000  // maximum number of vertices

typedef struct {
  int y;  // adjacency info
  int weight;  // edge weight, if any
  struct edgenode *next;  // next edge in list
} edgenode;

typedef struct {
  edgenode *edges[MAXV + 1];   // adjacency info
  int degree[MAXV + 1];  // outdegree of each vertex
  int nvertices;  // number of vertices in graph
  int nedges;  // number of edges in graph
  bool directed;  // is the graph directed
} graph;

void initialize_graph(graph *g, bool directed) {
  int i;
  g->nvertices = 0;
  g->nedges = 0;
  g->directed = directed;
  for (i = 1; i <= NMAX; ++i) {
    g->degree[i] = 0;
    g->edges[i] = NULL;
  }
}

void insert_edge(graph *g, int x, int y, bool directed) {
  edgenode *p;
  p = new edgenode;
  p-> weight = 0;
  p->y = y;
  p->next = g->edges[x];
  g->edges[x] = p;
  g->degree[x]++;
  if (directed == false) {
    insert_edge(g, y, x, true);
  } else {
    g->nedges++;
  }
}

void read_graph(graph *g, bool directed) {
  int i;
  int m;
  int x, y;
  initialize_graph(g, directed);
  scanf("%d %d", &(g->nvertices), &m);
  for (i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
    scanf("$d %d", &x, &y);
    insert_edge(g, x, y, directed);
  }
}

print_graph(graph *g) {
  int i;
  edgenode *p;
  for (i = 1; i <= g->nvertices; ++i) {
    printf("%d: ", i);
    p = g->edges[i];
    while (p != NULL) {
      printf("%d ", p->y);
      p = p->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}

** 5.5 Traversing a Graph
The key idea behind graph traversal is to mark each vertex when we
first visit it and keep track of what we have not yet completely
explored. Although bread crumbs or unraveled threads have been used to
mark visited places in fairy-tale mazes, we will rely on Boolean flags
or enumerated types.

Each vertex will exist in one of three states:
+ undiscovered– the vertex is in its initial, virgin state.
+ discovered– the vertex has been found, but we have not yet checked
  out all its incident edges.
+ processed– the vertex after we have visited all its incident edges.

** 5.6 Breadth-First Search
先遍历完一个点的所有相邻点。

#+begin_src c++
      bool processed[MAXV+1]; /* which vertices have been processed */
      bool discovered[MAXV+1]; /* which vertices have been found */
      int parent[MAXV+1]; /* discovery relation */
      
      initialize_search(graph *g)
      {
        int i; /* counter */
        for (i=1; i<=g->nvertices; i++) {
          processed[i] = discovered[i] = FALSE;
          parent[i] = -1;
        }
      }
    
    bfs(graph *g, int start)
    {
      queue q; /* queue of vertices to visit */
      int v; /* current vertex */
      int y; /* successor vertex */
      edgenode *p; /* temporary pointer */
      init_queue(&q);
      enqueue(&q,start);
      discovered[start] = TRUE;
      while (empty_queue(&q) == FALSE) {
        v = dequeue(&q);
        process_vertex_early(v);
        processed[v] = TRUE;
        p = g->edges[v];
        while (p != NULL) {
          y = p->y;
          if ((processed[y] == FALSE) || g->directed)
            process_edge(v,y);
          if (discovered[y] == FALSE) {
            enqueue(&q,y);
            discovered[y] = TRUE;
            parent[y] = v;
          }
          p = p->next;
        }
        process_vertex_late(v);
      }
    }
  
  find_path(int start, int end, int parents[])
  {
    if ((start == end) || (end == -1))
      printf("\n%d",start);
    else {
      find_path(start,parents[end],parents);
      printf(" %d",end);
    }
  }
#+end_src

Because vertices are discovered in order of increasing distance from the root,
this tree has a very important property. The unique tree path from the root to
each node x∈V uses the smallest number of edges (or equivalently, intermediate
nodes) possible on any root-to-xpath in the graph.

There are *two points* to remember when using breadth-first search to find a
shortest path fromxtoy: First, the shortest path tree is only useful if BFS was
performed with x as the root of the search. Second, BFS gives the shortest path
only if the graph is unweighted.

** 5.7 Applications of Breadth-First Search
Properly implemented using adjacency lists, any such algorithm is
destined to be linear, since BFS runs in O(n+m) time on both directed
and undirected graphs. This is optimal, since it is as fast as one can
hope to read any n-vertex, m-edge graph.
** 5.8 Depth-First Search
The difference between BFS and DFS results is in the order in which they
explore vertices. This order depends completely upon the container
data structure used to store the discovered but not processed
vertices.

+ Queue– By storing the vertices in a first-in, first-out (FIFO)
  queue, we explore the oldest unexplored vertices first. Thus our
  explorations radiate out slowly from the starting vertex, defining a
  breadth-first search.

+ Stack– By storing the vertices in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack,
  we explore the vertices by lurching along a path, visiting a new
  neighbor if one is available, and backing up only when we are
  surrounded by previously discovered vertices. Thus, our explorations
  quickly wanderaway from our starting point, defining a depth-first
  search.

DFS organizes vertices by entry/exit times, and edges into tree and
back edges. This organization is what gives DFS its real power.

*Implementation*

The beauty of implementingdfsrecursively is that recursion eliminates
the need to keep an explicit stack:

#+begin_src c++
  dfs(graph *g, int v)
  {
    edgenode *p; /* temporary pointer */
    int y; /* successor vertex */
    if (finished) return; /* allow for search termination */
    discovered[v] = TRUE;
    time = time + 1;
    entry_time[v] = time;
    process_vertex_early(v);
    p = g->edges[v];
    while (p != NULL) {
      y = p->y;
      if (discovered[y] == FALSE) {
        parent[y] = v;
        process_edge(v,y);
        dfs(g,y);
      }
      else if ((!processed[y]) || (g->directed))
        process_edge(v,y);
      if (finished) return;
      p = p->next;
    }
    process_vertex_late(v);
    time = time + 1;
    exit_time[v] = time;
    processed[v] = TRUE;
  }
#+end_src

** 5.9 Applications of Depth-First Search
*** Finding Cycles
But any back edge going from x to an ancestorycreates a cycle with the
tree path fromytox. Such a cycle is easy to find using dfs:

#+begin_src c++
  process_edge(int x, int y)
  {
    if (parent[x] != y) { /* found back edge! */
      printf("Cycle from %d to %d:",y,x);
      find_path(y,x,parent);
      printf("\n\n");
      finished = TRUE;
    }
  }
#+end_src
*** Articulation Vertices
Observe that there is a single point of failure—a single vertex whose
deletion disconnects a connected component of the graph. Such a vertex
is called an articulation vertex or cut-node.

More robust graphs without such a vertex are said to be biconnected.

Temporarily delete each vertex v, and then do a BFS or DFS traversal
of the remaining graph to establish whether it is still connected. The
total time fornsuch traversals is O(n(m+n)). There is a clever
linear-time algorithm, however, that tests all the vertices of a
connected graph using a single depth-first search.

Let =reachable_ancestor[v]= denote the earliest reachable ancestor of
vertex v, meaning the oldest ancestor ofvthat we can reach by a
combination of tree edges and back edges. Initially,
~reachable_ancestor[v] = v~:

#+begin_src c++
  int reachable_ancestor[MAXV+1]; /*earliestreachableancestorofv*/
  int tree_out_degree[MAXV+1];  /* DFStree outdegree ofv*/
  process_vertex_early(int v)
  {
    reachable_ancestor[v] = v;
  }
#+end_src

We update =reachable_ancestor[v]= whenever we encounter a back edge
that takes us to an earlier ancestor than we have previously seen. The
relative age/rank of our ancestors can be determined from
their =entry_time’s=:

#+begin_src c++
  process_edge(int x, int y)
  {
    int class; /* edge class */
    class = edge_classification(x,y);
    if (class == TREE)
      tree_out_degree[x] = tree_out_degree[x] + 1;
    if ((class == BACK) && (parent[x] != y)) {
      if (entry_time[y] < entry_time[ reachable_ancestor[x] ] )
        reachable_ancestor[x] = y;
    }
  }
#+end_src

The key issue is determining how the reachability relation impacts
whether vertexv is an articulation vertex. There are three cases:
+ Root cut-nodes– If the root of the DFS tree has two or more
  children, it must be an articulation vertex. No edges from the
  subtree of the second child can possibly connect to the subtree of
  the first child.

+ Bridge cut-nodes– If the earliest reachable vertex fromvis v, then
  deleting the single edge (parent[v],v) disconnects the graph.
  Clearlyparent[v] must be an articulation vertex, since it cuts v from
  the graph. Vertex vis also an articulation vertex unless it is a
  leaf of the DFS tree. For any leaf, nothing falls off when you cut it.
+ Parent cut-nodes– If the earliest reachable vertex fromvis the
  parent of v, then deleting the parent must severvfrom the tree
  unless the parent is the root.

[[./images/articulation_vertices.jpg]]

The routine below systematically evaluates each of the three
conditions as we back up from the vertex after traversing all outgoing
edges. We use =entry_time[v]= to represent the age of vertex v. The
reachability time =time_v= calculated below denotes the oldest vertex that
can be reached using back edges.

#+begin_src c++
  process_vertex_late(int v)
  {
    bool root; /* is the vertex the root of the DFS tree? */
    int time_v; /* earliest reachable time for v */
    int time_parent; /* earliest reachable time for parent[v] */
    if (parent[v] < 1) { /* test if v is the root */
      if (tree_out_degree[v] > 1)
        printf("root articulation vertex: %d \n",v);
      return;
    }
    root = (parent[parent[v]] < 1); /* is parent[v] the root? */
    if ((reachable_ancestor[v] == parent[v]) && (!root))
      printf("parent articulation vertex: %d \n",parent[v]);
    if (reachable_ancestor[v] == v) {
      printf("bridge articulation vertex: %d \n",parent[v]);
      if (tree_out_degree[v] > 0) /* test if v is not a leaf */
        printf("bridge articulation vertex: %d \n",v);
    }
    time_v = entry_time[reachable_ancestor[v]];
    time_parent = entry_time[ reachable_ancestor[parent[v]] ];
    if (time_v < time_parent)
      reachable_ancestor[parent[v]] = reachable_ancestor[v];
  }
#+end_src

We can alternately talk about reliability in terms of edge failures
instead of vertex failures. 

In fact
all bridges can be identified in the same O(n+m) time. Edge (x, y) is a
bridge if (1) it is a tree edge, and (2) no back edge connects from
yor below toxor above. This can be computed with a minor modification
of the =reachable_ancestor= function.

** 5.10 Depth-First Search on Directed Graphs
For directed graphs, depth-first search labelings can take on a wider
range of possibilities. Indeed, all four of the edge cases in Figure
below can occur in traversing directed graphs.

[[./images/edge_cases_for_traversl.jpg]]

The correct labeling of each edge can be readily determined from the
state, discovery time, and parent of each vertex, as encoded in the
following function:

#+begin_src c++
  int edge_classification(int x, int y)
  {
    if (parent[y] == x) return(TREE);
    if (discovered[y] && !processed[y]) return(BACK);
    if (processed[y] && (entry_time[y]>entry_time[x])) return(FORWARD);
    if (processed[y] && (entry_time[y]<entry_time[x])) return(CROSS);
    printf("Warning: unclassified edge (%d,%d)\n",x,y);
  }
#+end_src

*** Strongly Connected Components
A directed graph isstrongly connectedif there is a directed path
between any two vertices.

[[./images/strongly_connected_components.jpg]]

The algorithm is based on the observation that it is easy to find a
directed cycle using a depth-first search, since any back edge plus
the down path in the DFS tree gives such a cycle. All vertices in this
cycle must be in the same strongly connected component. Thus, we can
shrink (contract) the vertices on this cycle down to a single vertex
representing the component, and then repeat. This process terminates
when no directed cycle remains, and each vertex represents a different
strongly connected component.

We update our notion of the oldest reachable vertex in response to (1)
nontree edges and (2) backing up from a vertex.

#+begin_src c++
  strong_components(graph *g)
  {
    int i; /* counter */
    for (i=1; i<=(g->nvertices); i++) {
      low[i] = i;
      scc[i] = -1;
    }
    components_found = 0;
    init_stack(&active);
    initialize_search(&g);
    for (i=1; i<=(g->nvertices); i++)
      if (discovered[i] == FALSE) {
        dfs(g,i);
      }
  }
#+end_src

Define low[v]to be the oldest vertex known to be in the same strongly
connected component asv. This vertex is not necessarily an ancestor,
but may also be a distant cousin of v because of cross edges. Cross
edges that point vertices from previous strongly connected components
of the graph cannot help us, because there can be no way back from
them tov, but otherwise cross edges are fair game. Forward edges have
no impact on reachability over the depth-first tree edges, and hence
can be disregarded:

#+begin_src c++
  int low[MAXV+1]; /* oldest vertex surely in component of v */
  int scc[MAXV+1]; /* strong component number for each vertex */
  process_edge(int x, int y)
  {
    int class; /* edge class */
    class = edge_classification(x,y);
    if (class == BACK) {
      if (entry_time[y] < entry_time[ low[x] ] )
        low[x] = y;
    }
    if (class == CROSS) {
      if (scc[y] == -1) /* component not yet assigned */
        if (entry_time[y] < entry_time[ low[x] ] )
          low[x] = y;
    }
  }
#+end_src

A new strongly connected component is found whenever the lowest reachable
vertex fromvis v. If so, we can clear the stack of this component.
Otherwise, we give our parent the benefit of the oldest ancestor we
can reach and backtrack:

#+begin_src c++
    process_vertex_early(int v)
    {
      push(&active,v);
    }
  
  process_vertex_late(int v)
  {
    if (low[v] == v) { /* edge (parent[v],v) cuts off scc */
      pop_component(v);
    }
    if (entry_time[low[v]] < entry_time[low[parent[v]]])
      low[parent[v]] = low[v];
  }
  
  pop_component(int v)
  {
    int t; /* vertex placeholder */
    components_found = components_found + 1;
    scc[ v ] = components_found;
    while ((t = pop(&active)) != v) {
      scc[ t ] = components_found;
    }
  }
#+end_src

Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs
where each vertex has degree at most 2. Must such graphs be bipartite?

这样的图不必要是bipartite的.反例是:3个顶点,两两相连.

因为每个顶点最多2度,使用DFS遍历,对子顶点着色与父顶点相反的颜色.当遇到
一个回归的边,那么对当前定点着色与父顶点不同,并且与回归边上的祖先定点不

Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it
possible to reconstruct the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it.
If not, give a counterexample. Repeat the problem if you are given the
pre-order and post-order traversals.

tree.代码如下.若有相同元素,给予:

#+begin_src sh

 /           or          \
1                         1
#+end_src

每次preorder的数都要去搜索在inoder所在位置,若书是平衡的,那么n个元素每
次搜索后总的算法复杂度O(nlogn),但不是平衡的,一下就变成O(n^2).

所以利用hash table,先把inorder的元素和位置hash起来,那么总的算法时

 Consider a set of movies $M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_k$. There is a set of
 customers, each one of which indicates the two movies they would like
 to see this weekend. Movies are shown on Saturday evening and Sunday
 evening. Multiple movies may be screened at the same time. You must
 decide which movies should be televised on Saturday and which on
 Sunday, so that every customer gets to see the two movies they
 desire. Is there a schedule where each movie is shown at most once?
 Design an efficient algorithm to find such a schedule if one exists.

把问题转换成图问题解决。建立无向图，顶点是每部电影，边E(1,2)表示有个客
户想看M1和M2.如下图实例，有电影M1-M4,3个客户，1个客户想看M1和M3,一个客
户想看M1和M4，一个客户想看M2和M4.那么把图分成（M1，M2）和（M3,M4），周
六日各放一组,满足所有客户要求。

若多一个客户想看M3和M4,如下图，无论怎么分图，都有2部电影相连，所以不能

Your job is to arrange n ill-behaved children in a straight line,
facing front. You are given a list of m statements of the form i hates
j. If i hates j, then you do not want put i somewhere behind j,
because then i is capable of throwing something at j.

   possible) in O(m + n) time.

2. Suppose instead you want to arrange the children in rows such that

   an efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of rows needed,
