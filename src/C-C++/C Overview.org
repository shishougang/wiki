Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often
referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings,
hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.

A reliable pure C logging library.

** The C Book, second edition by Mike Banahan, Declan Brady and Mark Doran
http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/

** Programming in C (3rd Edition) by Stephen Kochan
[[pic][http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0672326663.01._PE_PI_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg]]
This book by Steve Kochan is absolutely the best book for anyone
starting out programming in C. This is an excellent introductory text
with frequent examples and good text. This book makes no assumptions
about the particular computer system or operating system on which the
C language is implemented. This books is written for novices and
experienced programmers alike. 

** Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets
[[pic][http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0131774298.01._PE_PI_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg]]
Peter has written one of the greatest books to hit the computer book
stands in a long time! This is not your typical C book, but is rather
a fun book to read. As I told Peter, most C programming texts are
really boring as all they do is describe the functions, give a
abstract example and then move onto something different. This book is
chock full of real world C stories and folklore, including a story
about the C bug that brought down the AT&T network. I found the
tongue-in-cheek attitude and real world examples/stories very, very
interesting. Run, don’t walk, down to your local store and buy this
book. I really really loved this book, and I read most of it in one
sitting. There is also a great introduction to C++ for C programmers
that will get you started with C++ and Object-Oriented programming.
This book is not for beginners, but is a great second book on C.
** The Waite Group’s Microsoft C Bible by Nabajyoti Barkakati(DOS)
[[pic][http://www.cyberdiem.com/vin/oop_detail.gif]]
This book is a must for every programmer, especially those who program
in the DOS environment. The Bible organizes and simplifies the
information contained in Microsoft’s C library. Each function page
gives the purpose, syntax, example call, includes, common uses,
returns and examples.

* Literature and links on C[fn:1]
** my personal best-of list


1. C - A Reference Manual (Harbison/Steele, Prentice Hall) is simply the best. The longer you have it the more you need it. A must-have!
2. C - A Software Engineering Approach (Darnell/Margolis, Springer) is an excellent teaching book. It presents not only the C programming language, but also typical procedures, style elements and programming techniques in a quite readable way.
3. Expert C Programming - Deep C Secrets (P. van der Linden, Prentice Hall) is both a very competent book on C and something just fun reading. Contains numerous tips and tricks as well as anecdotes on C and programming in general. I love it.
4. The GNU C Library Reference Manual (S. Loosemore, R. Stallman, R. McGrath, A. Oram, U. Drepper, available free in the internet as hypertext document) is one of the basic sources for people who program a lot on Unix-based systems. Though being a reference manual in the first place it also provides good explanations and introductions on the different of the GNU C library.
5. Programmieren mit C (Martin Lowes, Augustin Paulik, Teubner Verlag) is a good book for learning concentrating on ANSI-C. It also covers some typical applications like binary trees.
** Don't buy these, my personal Hall of Shame

1. The Annotated ANSI-C Standard (and anything else by Herbert
   Schildt, Osborne) may be the cheapest way to get hold of a printed
   copy of the ANSI-C standard, but never read his comments! That's
   what not only the [alt.comp.lang.learn.c-c++] - FAQ list
   recommends. Like stated by Peter Seebach in comp.lang.c Schildt has
   been the founding idea to many a good drinking game. He is said to
   have a clear style that leaves the reader confident but dangerously
   ignorant. For more information don't hesitate to read some of the
   following:
   
   + Clive Feather's review on Schildt's errors.
   + Peter Seebach's C: The Complete Nonsense contains some more incredible examples of Schildt's expertise.
   + Peter Seebach's April Fool's posting, declaring to pass on the moderation of comp.lang.c.moderated to Herbert Schildt.
2. C-Programmierung lernen (Andre Willms, Addison-Wesley, in German language) is a book for the novice constantly using incorrect (in the ANSI sense) code but still stating one needed to use an ANSI-C compiler to try his code examples - haha!
3. GoTo C-Programmierung (Guido Krüger, Addison-Wesley, in German language) is for the advanced novice and devastates the C language in a similar manner. Apart from using void main() all the time the book contains numerous survivors from the old K&R-times as well as descriptions of library functions that are plainly wrong when speaking of ANSI-C. My advice: better buy two books that have less than half as many pages but do exactly what they're supposed to do.
4. Effektiv Programmieren in C und C++ (Dietmar Herrmann, Vieweg Verlag) is another void main() publication that even goes further by adding a return statement to the end of main(). I still say: A book supporting this rubbish cannot be recommended no matter how good it might be in some other way.

(alternatively as [[http://herbert.the-little-red-haired-girl.org/dvi/pdf/canthappen.pdf][PDF File]]) A rather old but still up-to-date document on programming in C. It is based on the Unix environment and many examples mention implementation details from the mid-eighties' Unix world. However the shocking truth is: nothing has really changed since then, we're still making the same mistakes.

  classes and has placed their notes on the web; they are at
  http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/cclass.html.

+ Several of these tutorials, plus a great deal of other information
  about C, are accessible via the web at http://www.quut.com/c/.
