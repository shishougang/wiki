<h2 id="sec-1">Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Direct memory access (DMA) is a feature of modern computers that
allows certain hardware subsystems within the computer to access
system memory independently of the central processing unit
(CPU).<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The three primary data transfer mechanisms for computer-based data
acquisition are polling, interrupts (also known as programmed I/O),
and direct memory access (DMA).<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
DMA has several advantages over polling and interrupts.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>DMA is fast because a dedicated piece of hardware transfers data
from one computer location to another and only one or two bus
read/write cycles are required per piece of data transferred.
</li>
<li>DMA also minimizes latency in servicing a data acquisition device
because the dedicated hardware responds more quickly than
interrupts, and transfer time is short.
</li>
<li>DMA also off-loads the processor, which means the processor does not
have to execute any instructions to transfer data.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
A DMA controller manages several DMA channels, each of which can be
programmed to perform a sequence of these DMA transfers. Devices,
usually I/O peripherals, that acquire data that must be read (or
devices that must output data and be written to) signal the DMA
controller to perform a DMA transfer by asserting a hardware DMA
request signal. A DMA request signal for each channel is routed to the
DMA controller. This signal is monitored and responded to in much the
same way that a processor handles interrupts. When the DMA controller
sees a DMA request, the DMA controller responds by performing one or
many data transfers from that I/O device into system memory or vice
versa. Channels must be enabled by the processor for the DMA
controller to respond to DMA requests. The number of transfers
performed, transfer modes used, and memory locations accessed depends
on how the DMA channel is programmed.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./Files/DMA Controller Architecture.jpg" alt="DMA Controller Architecture.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
When the value in the
current count register goes from 0 to -1, a terminal count (TC) signal
is generated, which signifies the
completion of the DMA transfer sequence. This termination event is
referred to as reaching terminal count. DMA controllers often generate
a hardware TC pulse during the last cycle of a DMA transfer sequence.
This signal can be monitored by the I/O devices participating in the DMA
transfers.
</p>

<p>
DMA controllers require reprogramming when a DMA channel reaches TC.
Thus, DMA controllers require some CPU time, but far less than is
required for the CPU to service device I/O interrupts. When a DMA
channel reaches TC, the processor may need to reprogram the controller
for additional DMA transfers. Some DMA controllers interrupt the
processor whenever a channel terminates. DMA controllers also have
mechanisms for automatically reprogramming a DMA channel when the DMA
transfer sequence completes. These mechanisms include
<i>autoinitialization</i> and <i>buffer chaining</i>.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">Burst mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
An entire block of data is transferred in one contiguous sequence.
Once the DMA controller is granted access to the system bus by the
CPU, it transfers all bytes of data in the data block before releasing
control of the system buses back to the CPU. The mode is also called
<code>Block Transfer Mode</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Cycle stealing mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
In the cycle stealing mode, the DMA controller obtains access to the
system bus the same way as in burst mode, using BR (Bus Request) and
BG (Bus Grant) signals, which are the two signals controlling the
interface between the CPU and the DMA controller. However, in cycle
stealing mode, after one byte of data transfer, the control of the
system bus is deasserted to the CPU via BG. It is then continually
requested again via BR, transferring one byte of data per request,
until the entire block of data has been transferred.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Transparent mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The transparent mode takes the most time to transfer a block of data,
yet it is also the most efficient mode in terms of overall system
performance. The DMA controller only transfers data when the CPU is
performing operations that do not use the system buses. It is the
primary <b>advantage</b> of the transparent mode that the CPU never stops
executing its programs and the DMA transfer is free in terms of time.
The <b>disadvantage</b> of the transparent mode is that the hardware needs to
determine when the CPU is not using the system buses, which can be
complex and relatively expensive.

<h2 id="sec-4">Cache Coherency<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
On processors with a data cache an unwanted side effect of using DMA
is the possibility that the contents of the cache are no longer
coherent with respect to main memory which can lead to data corruption
problems. As with any memory corruption problem, these are notoriously
difficult to track down because the behaviour of the system may not be
predictable.
</p>

<p>
The problem occurs when a DMA transfer changes the contents of main
memory that has been cached by the processor. The data stored in the
cache will be the previous value. However, when the cache is flushed
the stale data will be written back to the main memory overwriting the
new data stored by the DMA.  The end result is that the data in main
memory is not correct.
</p>

<p>
A similar problem can also occur with transfers from main memory. If a
cached memory location is updated by the processor the new value in
the cache will be different to the value in main memory until the
cache is flushed. If a DMA transfer is initiated from main memory the
stale data will be transferred instead of the data updated by the
processor.
</p>

<p>
Some system hardware designs include a mechanism called bus snooping
or cache snooping; the snooping hardware notices when an external DMA
transfer refers to main memory using an address that matches data in
the cache, and either flushes/invalidates the cache entry or
“redirects” the transfer so that the DMA transfers the correct data
and the state of the cache entry is updated accordingly.  In systems
with snooping, DMA drivers don’t have to worry about cache coherency.
</p>

<p>
The second solution is for the device driver software to explicitly
flush or invalidate the data cache (depending on the transfer
direction) before initiating a transfer or making data buffers
available to bus mastering peripherals. This can also complicate the
software and will cause more transfers between cache and main memory
but it does allow the application to use any arbitrary region of
cached memory as a data buffer.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Buffer Alignment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
It is not unusual to find that DMA hardware needs data buffers or
control structures to be located in memory at specific address
boundaries (multiples of 8, 16, 32, etc). This simplifies the hardware
design particularly when data is transferred in burst mode.
</p>

<p>
If the device driver is responsible for allocating the data buffers
this is not normally a problem as there are standard routines, such as
memalign(), that return memory aligned to a given address boundary. If
the application is providing the buffer it may not be correctly
aligned for the device. Other than forcing the application to using
strictly aligned buffers, there are two possible solutions to this
sort of problem, with different levels of complexity.
</p>

<p>
The simplest solution is to copy the data from the misaligned user
buffer into a temporary buffer that is accessed during the DMA
operation. However, depending on the size of the data buffer and the
frequency of the data transfer this solution could add significant
extra processing effort and reduce any performance gains from using
DMA in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Another solution is to transfer the misaligned part of the buffer
using programmed I/O. The remaining data in the buffer will then be
correctly aligned for the hardware and can be transferred using DMA.
The hardware may also require the DMA transfer count (buffer size) to
be an integer multiple of the burst size. If this is the case the
software must also transfer any remainder using programmed I/O.
</p>

<p>
The simple solution to this problem is to ensure that buffers used for
DMA are multiples of the cache line size (typically 32 or 64 bytes)
and are aligned to a cache-line size boundary.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Debugging problems with DMA</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Dedicated DMA controllers and other DMA capable devices will usually
provide status registers and error interrupts that can inform software
if an error occurs. The status registers may give the transfer count,
source address and destination address when the error occurred. There
may also be bus-specific protocol registers that might show if the DMA
transfer terminated because of a bus error, for example due to a
misaligned access.
</p>

<p>
Bus analysers are also very useful tools for tracking down DMA errors.
They can show what is happening on the address and data bus between
the processor and the peripheral.  They can also be set up to trigger
and capture transactions that occur outside expected address windows
on the bus, which helps to limit the amount of data captured and
needing analysis.
