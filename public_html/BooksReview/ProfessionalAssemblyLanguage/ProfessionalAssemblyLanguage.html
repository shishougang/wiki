<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Often, the whole point of using assembly language is to exploit low-
level features of the processor within your application program. Knowing what elements can be
used to assist your programs in gaining the most speed possible can mean the difference between
a fast application and a slow application.
</p>

<p>
The hardware and instruction code set designed
for the Pentium processors is commonly referred to as the IA-32 platform.
</p>

<p>
The processor contains the hardware and instruction codes that control the operation of the computer. It
is connected to the other elements of the computer (the memory storage unit, input devices, and output
devices) using three separate buses: a control bus, an address bus, and a data bus.
</p>

<p>
The main components in the processor are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Control unit
</li>
<li>Execution unit
</li>
<li>Registers
</li>
<li>Flags
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Control unit</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Retrieve instructions from memory. 
</li>
<li>Decode instructions for operation. 
</li>
<li>Retrieve data from memory as needed.
</li>
<li>Store the results as necessary.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Because it takes considerably longer to retrieve data from memory
than to process it, a backlog occurs, whereby the processor is continually waiting for instructions and
data to be retrieved from memory. To solve this problem, the concept of prefetching was created.
</p>

<p>
To incorporate prefetching, a special storage
area is needed on the processor chip itself — one that can be easily accessed by the processor, quicker
than normal memory access. This was solved using pipelining.
</p>

<p>
The IA-32 platform implements pipelining by utilizing two (or more) layers of cache. The first cache
layer (called L1) attempts to prefetch both instruction code and data from memory as it thinks it will
be needed by the processor. As the instruction pointer moves along in memory, the prefetch algorithm
determines which instruction codes should be read and placed in the cache. In a similar manner, if data
is being processed from memory, the prefetch algorithm attempts to determine what data elements
may be accessed next and also reads them from memory and places them in cache.
</p>

<p>
Of course, one pitfall to caching instructions and data is that there is no guarantee that the program will
execute instructions in a sequential order.
</p>

<p>
To help alleviate this problem, a second cache layer was created. The second cache layer (called L2) can
also hold instruction code and data elements, separate from the first cache layer. When the program
logic jumps to a completely different area in memory to execute instructions, the second layer cache can
still hold instructions from the previous instruction location. If the program logic jumps back to the area,
those instructions are still being cached and can be processed almost as quickly as instructions stored in
the first layer cache.
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-2-1-1" name="sec-2-1-1"></a>Branch prediction unit<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
While implementing multiple layers of cache is one way to help speed up processing of program logic, it
still does not solve the problem of “jumpy” programs. 
</p>

<p>
To help solve this problem, the IA-32 platform processors also incorporate branch prediction. Branch pre-
diction uses specialized algorithms to attempt to predict which instruction codes will be needed next
within a program branch.
</p>

<p>
Special statistical algorithms and analysis are incorporated to determine the most likely path traveled
through the instruction code. Instruction codes along that path are prefetched and loaded into the cache
layers.
</p>

<p>
The Pentium 4 processor utilizes three techniques to implement branch prediction:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deep branch prediction
</li>
<li>Dynamic data flow analysis
</li>
<li>Speculative execution
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-2-1-2" name="sec-2-1-2"></a>Out-of-order execution engine<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
This is where instructions are prepared for processing by the execution unit. It contains
several buffers to change the order of instructions within the pipeline to increase the performance of the
control unit. 
</p>

<p>
Instructions retrieved from the prefetch and decoding pipeline are analyzed and reordered, enabling
them to be executed as quickly as possible. By analyzing a large number of instructions, the out-of-order
execution engine can find independent instructions that can be executed (and their results saved) until
required by the rest of the program. 
</p>
</div>
</li></ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Execution unit</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The main function of the processor is to execute instructions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Registers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
To help solve this problem, the processor includes internal memory locations, called registers. The regis-
ters are capable of storing data elements for processing without having to access the memory storage
unit. The downside to registers is that a limited number of them are built into the processor chip.
</p>

<p>
The core groups of registers available to all processors in the IA-32
family are shown in the following table.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>General purpose Eight 32-bit registers used for storing working data
</li>
<li>Segment Six 16-bit registers used for handling memory access
</li>
<li>Instruction pointer A single 32-bit register pointing to the next
instruction code to execute
</li>
<li>Floating-point data Eight 80-bit registers used for floating-point arithmetic data
</li>
<li>Control Five 32-bit registers used to determine the operating mode
of the processor
</li>
<li>Debug Eight 32-bit registers used to contain information when
debugging the processor
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-2-3-1" name="sec-2-3-1"></a>General-purpose registers<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
The general-purpose registers are used to temporarily store data as it
is processed on the processor.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-2-3-2" name="sec-2-3-2"></a>Segment registers<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-2">
<p>
The segment registers are used specifically for referencing memory locations. The IA-32 processor plat-
form allows three different methods of accessing system memory:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Flat memory model
</li>
<li>Segmented memory model
</li>
<li>Real-address mode
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The flat memory model presents all system memory as a contiguous address space. All instructions,
data, and the stack are contained in the same address space. Each memory location is accessed by a spe-
cific address, called a linear address.
</p>

<p>
The segmented memory model divides the system memory into groups of independent segments, refer-
enced by pointers located in the segment registers. Each segment is used to contain a specific type of
data. One segment is used to contain instruction codes, another data elements, and a third the program
stack.
</p>

<p>
Memory locations in segments are defined by logical addresses. A logical address consists of a segment
address and an offset address. The processor translates a logical address to a corresponding linear
address location to access the byte of memory.
</p>

<p>
If a program is using the real address mode, all of the segment registers point to the zero linear address,
and are not changed by the program. All instruction codes, data elements, and stack elements are
accessed directly by their linear address.

the x87 floating-point unit (FPU).

<li><a id="sec-2-4-2" name="sec-2-4-2"></a>Multimedia extensions (MMX)<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-2">
<p>
MMX was the first technology to support the Intel Single Instruction, Multiple
Data (SIMD) execution model.
</p>

<p>
The SIMD model was developed to process larger numbers, commonly found in multimedia applica-
tions. The SIMD model uses expanded register sizes and new number formats to speed up the complex
number crunching required for real-time multimedia presentations.
</p>

<p>
The MMX environment includes three new floating-point data types that can be handled by the
processor:
❑ 64-bit packed byte integers
❑ 64-bit packed word integers
❑ 64-bit packed doubleword integers
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="sec-2-4-3" name="sec-2-4-3"></a>Streaming SIMD extensions (SSE)<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-3">
<p>
SSE enhances performance for complex floating-point arithmetic, often used in 3-D graphics, motion video,
and video conferencing.
</p>

<p>
The second implementation of SSE (SSE2) in the Pentium 4 processors incorporates the same XMM reg-
isters that SSE uses, and also introduces five new data types:
❑ 128-bit packed double-precision floating point
❑ 128-bit packed byte integers
❑ 128-bit packed word integers
❑ 128-bit packed doubleword integers
❑ 128-bit packed quadword integers
</p>

<p>
A third implementation of SSE (SSE3) does not create any new data types, but provides several new
instructions for processing both integer and floating-point values in the XMM registers.

<li><a id="sec-3-1-2" name="sec-3-1-2"></a>The linker<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-2">
<p>
However, most assemblers do not automatically link the object code to produce the executable program
file. Instead, a second manual step is required to link the assembly language object code with other
libraries and produce an executable program file that can be run on the host operating system. This is
the job of the linker.

</div>
</li>
<li><a id="sec-3-1-3" name="sec-3-1-3"></a>The debugger<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-3">
<p>
Similar to assemblers, debuggers are specific to the operating system and hardware platform for which
the program was written. The debugger must know the instruction code set of the hardware platform,
and understand the registers and memory handling methods of the operating system.
</p>

<p>
Most debuggers provide four basic functions to the programmer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Running the program in a controlled environment, specifying any runtime parameters required
</li>
<li>Stopping the program at any point within the program
</li>
<li>Examining data elements, such as memory locations and registers
</li>
<li>Changing elements in the program while it is running, to facilitate
bug removal

<p>
The GNU compiler enables you to view the generated assembly
language code before it is assembled, but what about after the object file is already created?
</p>

<p>
A disassembler program takes either a full executable program or an object code file and displays the
instruction codes that will be run by the processor. Some disassemblers even take the process one step
further by converting the instruction codes into easily readable assembly language syntax.

<p>
Besides declaring the starting label in the application, you also need to make the entry point available

<p>
The .globl directive declares program labels that are accessible from external programs. If you are writ-
ing a bunch of utilities that are being used by external assembly or C language programs, each function
section label should be declared with a .globl directive.

<p>
The way this is done is called indexed memory mode. The memory location is determined by the
following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A base address
</li>
<li>An offset address to add to the base address
</li>
<li>The size of the data element
</li>
<li>An index to determine which data element to select
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The format of the expression is
<code>base_address(offset_address, index, size)</code>
The data value retrieved is located at
<code>base_address + offset_address + index * size</code>
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-5-2-4-4" name="sec-5-2-4-4"></a>Using indirect addressing with registers<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-5-2-4-4">
<p>
Besides holding data, registers can also be used to hold memory addresses. When a register holds a
memory address, it is referred to as a pointer. Accessing the data stored in the memory location using
the pointer is called indirect addressing.
</p>

<p>
While using a label references the data value contained in the memory location, you can get the memory
location address of the data value by placing a dollar sign ($) in front of the label in the instruction. Thus
the instruction
<code>movl $values, %edi</code>
</p>

<p>
The next instruction in the cpuid.s program:
<code>movl %ebx, (%edi)</code>
is the other half of the indirect addressing mode. Without the parentheses around the EDI register, the
instruction would just load the value in the EBX register to the EDI register. With the parentheses around
the EDI register, the instruction instead moves the value in the EBX register to the memory location con-
tained in the EDI register.
</p>

<p>
Instead of just allowing you to add a value to the register, you must place the value outside of the paren-
theses, like so:
</p>

<p>
<code>movl %edx, 4(%edi)</code>
This instruction places the value contained in the EDX register in the memory location 4 bytes after the
location pointed to by the EDI register. You can also go in the opposite direction:
</p>

<p>
<code>movl %edx, -4(&amp;edi)</code>
This instruction places the value in the memory location 4 bytes before the location pointed to by the
EDI register.

of them:
❑ Carry flag (CF) - bit 0 (lease significant bit)
❑ Overflow flag (OF) - bit 11
❑ Parity flag (PF) - bit 2

The IA-32 FLD instruction is used for loading single- and double-precision floating-point numbers stored
in memory onto the FPU register stack. To differentiate between the data sizes, the GNU assembler uses
the FLDS instruction for loading single-precision floating-point numbers, and the FLDL instruction for
loading double-precision floating-point numbers.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the FST instruction is used for retrieving the top value on the FPU register stack and placing
the value in a memory location. Again, for single-precision numbers, the instruction is FSTS, and for
double-precision numbers, FSTL.

</p>

<p>
where source can be an immediate value, a memory location, or a register. The destination param-
eter can be either a register or a value stored in a memory location (although you cannot use a memory
location for both the source and destination at the same time). The result of the addition is placed in the
destination location.
</p>

<p>
The ADD instruction can add 8-, 16-, or 32-bit values. As with other GNU assembler instructions, you
must specify the size of the operands by adding a b (for byte), w (for word), or l (for doubleword) to the
end of the ADD mnemonic.
</p>

<p>
The ADC instruction can be used to add two unsigned or signed integer values, along with the value con-
tained in the carry flag from a previous ADD instruction. To add multiple groups of bytes, you can chain
together multiple ADC instructions, as the ADC instruction also sets the carry and overflow flags as appro-
priate for the operation.
</p>

<p>
The format of the ADC instruction is
<code>adc source, destination</code>
where source can be an immediate value or an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit register or memory location value, and
destination can be an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit register or memory location value. (Similar to the ADD instruc-

be 8-, 16-, or 32-bit registers or values stored in memory (but again, they cannot both be memory locations at the same time). The
source value can also be an immediate data value.
</p>

<p>
Just like in addition, you can use the carry condition to your advantage to subtract large signed integer
values. The SBB instruction utilizes the carry and overflow flags in multibyte subtractions to implement
the borrow feature across data boundaries.
The format of the SBB instruction is
<code>sbb source, destination</code>
where the carry bit is added to the source value, and the result is subtracted from the destination
value. The result is stored in the destination location

<p>
he format for the MUL instruction is
<code>mul source</code>
where source can be an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit register or memory value. You might be wondering how you
can multiply two values by only supplying one operand in the instruction line. The answer is that the
destination operand is implied.
</p>

<p>
Working with the implied destination operand is somewhat complicated. For one thing, the destination
location always uses some form of the EAX register, depending on the size of the source operand. Thus,
one of the operands used in the multiplication must be placed in the AL, AX, or EAX registers, depending
on the size of the value.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, when multiplying a 16-bit source operand, the EAX register is not used to hold the 32-bit
result. In order to be backwardly compatible with older processors, Intel uses the DX:AX register pair to
hold the 32-bit multiplication result value (this format started back in the 16-bit processor days). The
high-order word of the result is stored in the DX register, while the low-order word is stored in the AX
register.
</p>

<p>
For 32-bit source values, the 64-bit EDX:EAX register pair is used, again with the high-order doubleword
in the EDX register, and the low-order doubleword in the EAX. Make sure that if you have data stored in
the EDX (or DX) register that you save it elsewhere when using the 16- or 32-bit versions of MUL.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">8 bits AL AX

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The first format of the IMUL instruction takes one operand, and behaves exactly the same as the MUL
instruction:
<code>imul source</code>
</p>

<p>
The second format of the IMUL instruction enables you to specify a destination operand other than the
EAX register:
<code>imul source, destination</code>
where source can be a 16- or 32-bit register or value in memory, and destination must be a 16- or
32-bit general-purpose register. This format enables you to specify where the result of the multiplication
will go (instead of being forced to use the AX and DX registers).
</p>

<p>
he third format of the IMUL instruction enables you to specify three operands:
<code>imul multiplier, source, destination</code>
where multiplier is an immediate value, source is a 16- or 32-bit register or value in memory, and
destination must be a general-purpose register. This format enables you to perform a quick multi-
plication of a value (the source) with a signed integer (the multiplier), storing the result in a general-
purpose register (the destination).

The DIV instruction is used for dividing unsigned integers. The format of the DIV instruction is
<code>div divisor</code>
</p>

<p>
where divisor is the value that is divided into the implied dividend, and can be an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit reg-
ister or value in memory. The dividend must already be stored in the AX register (for a 16-bit value), the
DX:AX register pair (for a 32-bit value), or the EDX:EAX register pair (for a 64-bit value) before the DIV
instruction is performed.

The IDIV instruction is used exactly like the DIV instruction, but for dividing signed integers. It too uses
an implied dividend, located in the AX register, the DX:AX register pair, or the EDX:EAX register pair.

used in the division:

<p>
To multiply integers by a power of 2, you must shift the value to the left. Two instructions can be used to
left shift integer values, SAL (shift arithmetic left) and SHL (shift logical left). Both of these instructions
perform the same operation, and are interchangeable. They have three different formats:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">sal destination
sal %cl, destination
sal shifter, destination
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The first format shifts the destination value left one position, which is the equivalent of multiplying
the value by 2.
</p>

<p>
The second format shifts the destination value left by the number of
times specified in the CL register.
</p>

<p>
The final version shifts the destination value left the number of
times indicated by the shifter value.

The SHR instruction clears the bits emptied
by the shift, which makes it useful only for shifting unsigned integers. The SAR instruction either clears
or sets the bits emptied by the shift, depending on the sign bit of the integer. For negative numbers, the
bits are set to 1, but for positive numbers, they are cleared to zero.

However, just writing functions in assembly language code instead of C or C++ does not necessarily
make them perform better. Remember, the GNU compiler already converts all of your high-level
language code to assembly language, so writing a function in assembly language just means that
you did it instead of the compiler.

<h3 id="sec-9-1">Optimized Compiler Code</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
The -O family of compiler options provides steps of optimization for the GNU compiler. Each step provides
a higher level of optimization. There are currently three steps available for optimizing:
</p>

<p>
❑ -O: Provides a basic level of optimization
❑ -O2: Provides more advanced code optimization
❑ -O3: Provides the highest level of optimization
</p>

<p>
Each individual optimization technique can be referenced using the -f command-
line option. The -O options bundle various -f options together in a single option.
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-9-1-1" name="sec-9-1-1"></a>Compiler optimization level 1<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-1-1">
<p>
The -f optimization functions included at this level are described in
the following list:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">&#10065; -fdefer-pop: This optimization technique is related to how the assembly language code acts when
a <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">is</span> finished. Normally, input values for functions are placed on the stack and accessed
by the function. When the <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">returns</span>, the input values are still on the stack. Normally, the
input values are popped from the stack immediately following the <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">return.</span>
This option permits the compiler to allow input values to accumulate on the stack across func-
tion calls. The accumulated input values are then removed all at once with a single instruction
(usually by changing the stack pointer to the proper value). For most operations this is perfectly
legal, as input values for new functions are placed on top of the old input values. However, this
does make things somewhat messy on the stack.

&#10065; -fthread-jumps: This optimization technique relates to how the compiler handles both condi-
       tional and unconditional branches<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> the assembly code. In some cases, one jump instruction
      may lead to another conditional branch statement. By threading jumps, the compiler determines
     the final destination between multiple jumps and redirects the first jump to the final destination.

&#10065; -fmerge-constants: With this optimization technique, the compiler attempts to merge identical
constants. This feature can sometimes result<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> long compile times, as the compiler must analyze
every constant used<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> the C or C++ program, comparing them with one another.

&#10065; -floop-optimize: By optimizing how loops are generated<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> the assembly language, the com-
piler can greatly increase the performance of the application. Often, programs consist of many
loops that are large and complex. By removing variable assignments that do not change value
within the loops, the number of instructions performed within the loop can be reduced, greatly improving performance. In addition, any conditional branches made to determine when to
leave the loop are optimized to reduce the effects of the branching.

&#10065; -fif-conversion: Next to loops, if-then statements are the second most time-consuming part of
   an application. A simple if-then statement can generate numerous conditional branches<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> the
  final assembly language code. By reducing or eliminating conditional branches and replacing
 them with conditional moves, setting flags, and performing arithmetic tricks, the compiler can
reduce the amount of time spent<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> the if-then statements.

&#10065; -fif-conversion2: This technique incorporates more advanced mathematical features that reduce
   the conditional branching required to implement the if-then statements.

&#10065; -fdelayed-branch: This technique attempts to reorder instructions based on instruction cycle
   times. It also attempts to move as many instructions before conditional branches as possible to
  maximize the use of the processor instruction cache.

&#10065; -fguess-branch-probability: As its name suggests, this technique attempts to determine the
   most likely outcome of conditional branches, and moves instructions accordingly, similar to the
  delayed-branch technique. Because the code placement is predicted at compile time, it is quite
 possible that compiling the same C or C++ code twice using this option can produce different
assembly language source code, depending on what branches the compiler thought would be
used at compile time.
Because of this, many programmers prefer not to incorporate this feature, and specifically
include the &#8211;fno-guess-branch-probability option to turn it off.

&#10065; -fcprop-registers: As registers are allocated to variables within functions, the compiler performs
a second pass to reduce scheduling dependencies (two sections requiring the same register) and
eliminate needlessly copying registers.

</li>

<li><a id="sec-9-1-2" name="sec-9-1-2"></a>Compiler optimization level 2<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-9-1-2">
<p>
The second level of code optimization (-O2) incorporates all of the optimization techniques of the first
level, plus a lot of additional techniques. These techniques are related to more specific types of code,
such as loops and conditional branches. If the basic assembly language code generated by the compiler
does not utilize the type of code analyzed in this level, no additional optimization will be performed.
The following list describes the additional -f optimization options that are attempted at this level.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">&#10065; -fforce-mem: This optimization forces all variables stored<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> memory locations to be copied to
   registers before using them<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> any instructions. For variables that are only involved<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> a single
  instruction, this may not be much of an optimization. However, for variables that are involved
 <span style="color: #00ffff;">in</span> a lot of instructions (such as mathematical operations), this can be a huge optimization, as the
processor can access the value<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> a register much quicker than<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> memory.
&#10065; -foptimize-sibling-calls: This technique deals with <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">calls</span> that are related and/or recur-
   sive. Often, recursive <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">calls</span> can be unrolled into a common string of instructions, rather
  than using branching. This enables the processor instruction cache to load the unrolled instruc-
 tions and process them faster than if they remain as separate <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">calls</span> requiring branching.
&#10065; -fstrength-reduce: This optimization technique performs loop optimization and eliminates itera-
   tion variables. Iteration variables are variables that are tied to loop counters, such as for-next loops
  that use a variable and then perform mathematical operations using the loop counter variable.

&#10065;
-fgcse: This performs Global Common Subexpression Elimination (gcse) routines on all of the
generated assembly language code. These optimizations attempt to analyze the generated
assembly language code and combine common pieces, eliminating redundant code segments.
It should be noted that the gcc instructions recommend using &#8211;fno-gcse if the code uses
computed gotos.
&#10065; &#10065; -frerun-cse-after-loop: This technique reruns the Common Subexpression Elimination routines
       after any loops have been optimized. This enables loop code to be further optimized after it has
      been unrolled.
&#10065; -fdelete-null-pointer-checks: This optimization technique scans the generated assembly language
   code for code that checks for null pointers. The compiler assumes that dereferencing a null pointer
  would halt the program. If a pointer is checked after it has been dereferenced, it cannot be null.
&#10065; -fexpensive-optimizations: This performs various optimization techniques that are expensive
   from a compile-time point of view, but it can have a negative effect on runtime performance.
&#10065; -fregmove: The compiler will attempt to reassign registers used<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> MOV instructions and as
   operands of other instructions<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> order to maximize the amount of register tying.
&#10065; -fschedule-insns: The compiler will attempt to reorder instructions<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> order to eliminate proces-
   sor waits for data. For processors that have delays associated with floating-point arithmetic, this
  enables the processor to load other instructions while it waits for the floating-point results.
&#10065; -fsched-interblock: This technique enables the compiler to schedule instructions across blocks
   of instructions. This provides greater flexibility<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> moving instructions around to maximize
  work done during wait times.
&#10065; -fcaller-saves: This option instructs the compiler to save and restore registers around <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span>
   calls to enable the functions to clobber register values without having to save and restore them.
  This can be a time-saver if multiple functions are called because the registers are saved and
 restored only once, instead of within each <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">call.</span>
&#10065; -fpeephole2: This option enables any machine-specific peephole optimizations.
&#10065; -freorder-blocks: This optimization technique enables blocks of instructions to be reordered to
   improve branching and code locality.
&#10065; -fstrict-aliasing: This technique enforces strict variable rules for the higher-level language. For C
   and C++ programs, it ensures that variables are not shared between data types. For example, an
  <span style="color: #b0c4de;">integer</span> variable cannot use the same memory location as a single-precision floating-point variable.
&#10065; -funit-at-a-time: This optimization technique instructs the compiler to read the entire assembly
   language code before running the optimization routines. This enables the compiler to reorder
  non-time-sensitive code to optimize the instruction cache. However, it takes considerably more
 memory during compile time, which may be a problem for smaller machines.
&#10065; -fcse-follow-jumps: This particular Common Subexpression Elimination (cse) technique
scans through a jump instruction looking for destination code that is not reached via any other
means within the program. The most common example of this is the else part of if-then-
<span style="color: #00ffff;">else</span> statements.

-falign-functions: This option is used to align functions at the start of a specific boundary<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span>
memory. Most processors read memory<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> pages, and enabling an entire <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">code</span> to reside
<span style="color: #00ffff;">in</span> a single page can improve performance. If a <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">crosses</span> pages, another page of memory
must be processed to complete the function.

&#10065; -falign-loops: Similar to aligning functions, loops that contain code that is processed multiple times
   can benefit from being aligned within a page boundary<span style="color: #00ffff;"> in</span> memory. When the loop is processed, if it
  is contained within a single memory page, no swapping of pages is required for the code.
&#10065; -fcrossjumping: The process of cross-jumping transforms code to combine equivalent code
   scattered throughout the program. This saves code size, but it may not have a direct impact on
  program performance.

  tions that are called multiple times, the <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">code</span> is duplicated for each <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">call.</span> While
 this may not be good for code size, it can increase performance by maximizing the instruction
cache code usage, instead of branching on each <span style="color: #00ffff;">function</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">call.</span>
&#10065; -fweb: This constructs a web of pseudo-registers to hold variables. The pseudo-registers contain
   data as if they were registers, but can be optimized by the various other optimization techniques,
  such as cse and loop optimizing.
&#10065; -fgcse-after-reload: This technique performs a second gcse optimization after completely
   reloading the generated and optimized assembly language code. This helps eliminate any
  redundant sections created by the different optimization passes.
