<h3 id="sec-1-1">The Programming Systems Product</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">

<p>Moving down across the horizontal boundary, a program
becomes a programming product. This is a program that can be run,tested, repaired, and extended by anybody. It is usable in many
operating environments, for many sets of data. To become a generally
usable programming product, a program must be written in a
generalized fashion. In particular the range and form of inputs
must be generalized as much as the basic algorithm will reasonably
allow. Then the program must be thoroughly tested, so that it can
be depended upon. This means that a substantial bank of test
cases, exploring the input range and probing its boundaries, must
be prepared, run, and recorded. Finally, promotion of a program
to a programming product requires its thorough documentation, so
that anyone may use it, fix it, and extend it. As a rule of thumb,
I estimate that a programming product costs at least three times as
much as a debugged program with the same function.
</p>
<p>
Moving across the vertical boundary, a program becomes a
component in a programming system. This is a collection of interacting
programs, coordinated in function and disciplined in format,
so that the assemblage constitutes an entire facility for large tasks.
To become a programming system component, a program must be
written so that every input and output conforms in syntax and
semantics with precisely defined interfaces. The program must
also be designed so that it uses only a prescribed budget of resources—
memory space, input-output devices, computer time. Finally,
the program must be tested with other system components,
in all expected combinations. This testing must be extensive, for
the number of cases grows combinatorially. It is time-consuming,
for subtle bugs arise from unexpected interactions of debugged
components. A programming system component costs at least
three times as much as a stand-alone program of the same function.
The cost may be greater if the system has many components.
</p>
<p>
In the lower right-hand corner of Fig. 1.1 stands the programming
systems product. This differs from the simple program in all of
the above ways. It costs nine times as much. But it is the truly
useful object, the intended product of most system programming
efforts.

<h3 id="sec-1-2">The Joys of the Craft</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">

<p>First is the sheer joy of making things
</p>
<p>
Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to
other people.
</p>
<p>
Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like
objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in
subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in
from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the
nonrepeating nature of the task.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable
medium.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">The Woes of the Craft</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">

<p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the
magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of
the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't
work.
</p>
<p>
Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources,
and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the
circumstances of his work, or even its goal.
</p>
<p>
The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding
nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no
exception.
</p>
<p>
Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or
worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach
to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking
more time to find than the first.
</p>
<p>
The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product
over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon
(or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in
hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the displacement of
one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.

<h2 id="sec-2">The Mythical Man-Month</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time
than for all other causes combined. Why is this cause of disaster
so common?
</p>
<p>
First, our techniques of estimating are poorly developed.
</p>
<p>
Second, our estimating techniques fallaciously confuse effort
with progress, hiding the assumption that men and months are
interchangeable.
</p>
<p>
Third, because we are uncertain of our estimates, software
managers often lack the courteous stubbornness of Antoine's chef.
</p>
<p>
Fourth, schedule progress is poorly monitored.
</p>
<p>
Fifth, when schedule slippage is recognized, the natural (and
traditional) response is to add manpower.
</p>
<p>
For some years I have been successfully using the following
rule of thumb for scheduling a software task:
</p>
<p class="verse">
l/3 planning<br/>
l/6 coding<br/>
l/4 component test and early system test<br/>
l/4 system test, all components in hand.<br/>
</p>


<p>
This differs from conventional scheduling in several important
ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The fraction devoted to planning is larger than normal. Even
</li>
</ol>

<p>so, it is barely enough to produce a detailed and solid specification,
and not enough to include research or exploration of
totally new techniques.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The half of the schedule devoted to debugging of completed
</li>
</ol>

<p>code is much larger than normal.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The part that is easy to estimate, i.e., coding, is given only
</li>
</ol>

<p>one-sixth of the schedule.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Mills's Proposal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">

<p>Mills proposes that each segment of a large job be tackled
by a team, but that the team be organized like a surgical team
rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member
cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the
others give him every support that will enhance his effectiveness
and productivity.
</p>
<p>
The surgeon. Mills calls him a chief programmer. He personally
defines the functional and performance specifications, designs the
program, codes it, tests it, and writes its documentation.
</p>
<p>
The copilot. He is the alter ego of the surgeon, able to do any
part of the job, but is less experienced. His main function is to
share in the design as a thinkerrdiscussant, and evaluator. The
surgeon tries ideas on him, but is not bound by his advice. The
copilot often represents his team in discussions of function and
interface with other teams. He knows all the code intimately. He
researches alternative design strategies. He obviously serves as
insurance against disaster to the surgeon. He may even write code,
but he is not responsible for any part of the code.
</p>
<p>
The administrator. The surgeon is boss, and he must have the
last word on personnel, raises, space, and so on, but he must spend
almost none of his time on these matters. Thus he needs a professional
administrator who handles money, people, space, and machines,
and who interfaces with the administrative machinery of
the rest of the organization. Baker suggests that the administrator
has a full-time job only if the project has substantial legal, contractual,
reporting, or financial requirements because of the userproducer
relationship. Otherwise, one administrator can serve two
teams.
</p>
<p>
The editor. The surgeon is responsible for generating the documentation—
for maximum clarity he must write it. This is true of
both external and internal descriptions. The editor, however, takes
the draft or dictated manuscript produced by the surgeon and
criticizes it, reworks it, provides it with references and bibliography,
nurses it through several versions, and oversees the mechanics
of production.
</p>
<p>
Two secretaries. The administrator and the editor will each need
a secretary; the administrator's secretary will handle project correspondence
and non-product files.
</p>
<p>
The program clerk. He is responsible for maintaining all the
technical records of the team in a programming-product library.
The clerk is trained as a secretary and has responsibility for both
machine-readable and human-readable files.
</p>
<p>
The toolsmith. File-editing, text-editing, and interactive debugging
services are now readily available, so that a team will rarely
need its own machine and machine-operating crew. But these
services must be available with unquestionably satisfactory response
and reliability; and the surgeon must be sole judge of the
adequacy of the service available to him. He needs a toolsmith,
responsible for ensuring this adequacy of the basic service and for
constructing, maintaining, and upgrading special tools—mostly
interactive computer services—needed by his team. Each team will
need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability
of any centrally provided service, for his job is to see to the tools
needed or wanted by his surgeon, without regard to any other
team's needs. The tool-builder will often construct specialized
utilities, catalogued procedures, macro libraries.
</p>
<p>
The tester. The surgeon will need a bank of suitable test cases
for testing pieces of his work as he writes it, and then for testing
the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
The language lawyer. By the time Algol came along, people
began to recognize that most computer installations have one or
two people who delight in mastery of the intricacies of a programming
language.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">How It Works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">

<p>Notice in particular the differences between a team of two
programmers conventionally organized and the surgeon-copilot
team. First, in the conventional team the partners divide the work,
and each is responsible for design and implementation of part of
the work. In the surgical team, the surgeon and copilot are each
cognizant of all of the design and all of the code. This saves the
labor of allocating space, disk accesses, etc. It also ensures the
conceptual integrity of the work.
</p>
<p>
 In the surgical team, there are no
differences of interest, and differences of judgment are settled by
the surgeon unilaterally. These two differences—lack of division
of the problem and the superior-subordinate relationship—make
it possible for the surgical team to act uno animo.

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Conceptual Integrity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">

<p>I will contend that conceptual integrity is the most important
consideration in system design. It is better to have a system omit
certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one
set of design ideas, than to have one that contains many good but
independent and uncoordinated ideas.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Achieving Conceptual Integrity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">

<p>Because ease of use is the purpose, this ratio of function to
conceptual complexity is the ultimate test of system design. Nei-
ther function alone nor simplicity alone defines a good design.
</p>
<p>
Simplicity and straightfor-
wardness proceed from conceptual integrity. Every part must re-
flect the same philosophies and the same balancing of desiderata.
Every part must even use the same techniques in syntax and
analogous notions in semantics. Ease of use, then, dictates unity
of design, conceptual integrity.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Aristocracy and Democracy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">

<p>Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed
from one mind, or from a very small number of agreeing resonant
minds.
</p>
<p>
Schedule pressures, however, dictate that system building
needs many hands. Two techniques are available for resolving this
dilemma. The first is a careful division of labor between architec-
ture and implementation. The second is the new way of structur-
ing programming implementation teams discussed in the previous
chapter.
</p>
<p>
The separation of architectural effort from implementation is
a very powerful way of getting conceptual integrity on very large
projects.
</p>
<p>
By the architecture of a system, I mean the complete and de-
tailed specification of the user interface. For a computer this is the
programming manual. For a compiler it is the language manual. For
a control program it is the manuals for the language or languages
used to invoke its functions. For the entire system it is the union
of the manuals the user must consult to do his entire job.
</p>
<p>
Architecture must be carefully distinguished from implemen-
tation. As Blaauw has said, "Where architecture tells what hap-
pens, implementation tells how it is made to happen."
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4">What Does the Implementer Do While Waiting?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">

<p>The architecture manager had 10 good men. He asserted that
they could write the specifications and do it right.
</p>
<p>
The control program manager had 150 men. He asserted that
they could prepare the specifications, with the architecture team
coordinating; it would be well-done and practical, and he could do
it on schedule. 
</p>
<p>
As Blaauw points out, the total creative effort involves three
distinct phases: architecture, implementation, and realization. It
turns out that these can in fact be begun in parallel and proceed
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
In computer design, for example, the implementer can start as
soon as he has relatively vague assumptions about the manual,
somewhat clearer ideas about the technology, and well-defined
cost and performance objectives. He can begin designing data
flows, control sequences, gross packaging concepts, and so on. He
devises or adapts the tools he will need, especially the record-
keeping system, including the design automation system.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">

<p>The architect has two possible answers when confronted with
an estimate that is too high: cut the design or challenge the esti-
mate by suggesting cheaper implementations. This latter is inher-
ently an emotion-generating activity. The architect is now
challenging the builder's way of doing the builder's job. For it to
be successful, the architect must
• remember that the builder has the inventive and creative re-
sponsibility for the implementation; so the architect suggests,
not dictates;
• always be prepared to suggest a way of implementing any-
thing he specifies, and be prepared to accept any other way
that meets the objectives as well;
• deal quietly and privately in such suggestions;
• be ready to forego credit for suggested improvements.

<h3 id="sec-5-2">Self-Discipline—The Second-System Effect</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">

<p>How does the architect avoid the second-system effect? Well,
obviously he can't skip his second system. But he can be conscious
of the peculiar hazards of that system, and exert extra self-disci-
pline to avoid functional ornamentation and to avoid extrapola-
tion of functions that are obviated by changes in assumptions and
purposes.
</p>
<p>
A discipline that will open an architect's eyes is to assign each
little function a value: capability x is worth not more than m bytes
of memory and n microseconds per invocation. These values will
guide initial decisions and serve during implementation as a guide
and warning to all.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">

<p>I think the finest piece of manual writing I have ever seen is
Blaauw's Appendix to System/360 Principles of Operation. This de-
scribes with care and precision the limits of System/360 compati-
bility. It defines compatibility, prescribes what is to be achieved,
and enumerates those areas of external appearance where the ar-
chitecture is intentionally silent and where results from one model
may differ from those of another, where one copy of a given model
may differ from another copy, or where a copy may differ even
from itself after an engineering change. This is the level of preci-
sion to which manual writers aspire, and they must define what
is not prescribed as carefully as what is.

<div id="outline-container-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2">Formal Definitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">

<p>English, or any other human language, is not naturally a precision
instrument for such definitions. Therefore the manual writer must
strain himself and his language to achieve the precision needed.
An attractive alternative is to use a formal notation for such definitions. 
</p>
<p>
An ancient adage warns, "Never go to sea with two chronom-
eters; take one or three." The same thing clearly applies to prose
and formal definitions. If one has both, one must be the standard,
and the other must be a derivative description, clearly labeled as
such. Either can be the primary standard. Algol 68 has a formal
definition as standard and a prose definition as descriptive. PL/I
has the prose as standard and the formal description as derivative.
</p>
<p>
Many tools are available for formal definition. The Backus-
Naur Form is familiar for language definition, and it is amply
discussed in the literature.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.1" href="#fn-.1">1</a></sup> The formal description of PL/I uses
new notions of abstract syntax, and it is adequately described.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.2" href="#fn-.2">2</a></sup>
Iverson's APL has been used to describe machines, most notably
the IBM 7090<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.3" href="#fn-.3">3</a></sup> and System/360.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.4" href="#fn-.4">4</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Bell and Newell have proposed new notations for describing
both configurations and machine architectures, and they have il-
lustrated these with several machines, including the DEC PDP-8,<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.5" href="#fn-.5">5</a></sup>
the 7090<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.5.2" href="#fn-.5">5</a></sup>, and System/360.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.6" href="#fn-.6">6</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
t is an implementation; it
runs. So all questions of definition can be resolved by testing it.
</p>
<p>
Using an implementation as a definition has some advantages.
All questions can be settled unambiguously by experiment. De-
bate is never needed, so answers are quick. Answers are always as
precise as one wants, and they are always correct, by definition.
</p>

<p>
The implementation as a definition overprescribed; it not only said what the machine must do, it also said a
great deal about how it had to do it.
</p>
<p>
Then, too, the implementation will sometimes give unex-
pected and unplanned answers when sharp questions are asked,
and the de facto definition will often be found to be inelegant in
these particulars precisely because they have never received any
thought. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, the use of an implementation as a formal definition is
peculiarly susceptible to confusion as to whether the prose de-
scription or the formal description is in fact the standard. This is
especially true of programmed simulations.

<h3 id="sec-7-3">The Project Workbook</h3>

<p>What. All the documents of the project need to be part of this struc-
ture. This includes objectives, external specifications, interface
specifications, technical standards, internal specifications, and ad-
ministrative memoranda.
</p>
<p>
Why. Technical prose is almost immortal. If one examines the
genealogy of a customer manual for a piece of hardware or soft-
ware, one can trace not only the ideas, but also many of the very
sentences and paragraphs back to the first memoranda proposing
the product or explaining the first design.
</p>
<p>
it is very important to get the
structure of the documentation right. The early design of the
project workbook ensures that the documentation structure itself
is crafted, not haphazard. Moreover, the establishment of a struc-
ture molds later writing into segments that fit into that structure.
</p>
<p>
The second reason for the project workbook is control of the
distribution of information.
</p>
<p>
Mechanics. First, one must
mark changed text on the page, e.g., by a vertical bar in the margin
alongside every altered line. Second, one needs to distribute with
the new pages a short, separately written change summary that
lists the changes and remarks on their significance.
</p>
<p>
On balance I think the microfiche was a very happy mecha-
nism, and I would recommend it over a paper workbook for very
large projects.
</p>
<p>
How would one do it today? With today's system technology
available, I think the technique of choice is to keep the workbook
on the direct-access file, marked with change bars and revision
dates. Each user would consult it from a display terminal

<h3 id="sec-7-4">Organization in the Large Programming Project</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-4">

<p>If there are n workers on a project, there are (n<sup>2</sup>-n)/2 interfaces
across which there may be communication, and there are poten-
tially almost 2<sup>n</sup> teams within which coordination must occur. The
purpose of organization is to reduce the amount of communication and coordination necessary; hence organization is a radical attack
on the communication problems treated above.
</p>
<p>
The means by which communication is obviated are division of
labor and specialization of function. The tree-like structure of orga-
nizations reflects the diminishing need for detailed communica-
tion when division and specialization of labor are applied.
</p>
<p>
Let us consider a tree-like programming organization, and
examine the essentials which any subtree must have in order to be
effective. They are:
</p><ol>
<li>a mission
</li>
<li>a producer
</li>
<li>a technical director or architect
</li>
<li>a schedule
</li>
<li>a division of labor
</li>
<li>interface definitions among the parts
</li>
</ol>


<p>
What is the role of the producer? He assembles the team,
divides the work, and establishes the schedule. He acquires and
keeps on acquiring the necessary resources.This means that a
major part of his role is communication outside the team, upwards
and sideways. He establishes the pattern of communication and
reporting within the team. Finally, he ensures that the schedule is
met, shifting resources and organization to respond to changing
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
How about the technical director? He conceives of the design
to be built, identifies its subparts, specifies how it will look from
outside, and sketches its internal structure. He provides unity and
conceptual integrity to the whole design; thus he serves as a limit
on system complexity. As individual technical problems arise, he
invents solutions for them or shifts the system design as required.
</p>
<p>
The producer and the technical director may be the same man.
This is readily workable on very small teams, perhaps three to six
programmers. On larger projects it is very rarely workable, for two
reasons. First, the man with strong management talent and strong
technical talent is rarely found. Thinkers are rare; doers are rarer;
and thinker-doers are rarest.
</p>
<p>
The producer may be boss, the director his right-hand man.

</p>


<p>
How long will a system programming job take? How much effort
will be required? How does one estimate?
</p>
<p>
First, one must say
that one does not estimate the entire task by estimating the coding
portion only and then applying the ratios. The coding is only
one-sixth or so of the problem, and errors in its estimate or in the
ratios could lead to ridiculous'results.
</p>
<p>
Second, one must say that data for building isolated small
programs are not applicable to programming systems products.
Planning, documentation, testing, system integration,
and training times must be added. The linear extrapolation of such
sprint figures is meaningless. Extrapolation of times for the hun-
dred-yard dash shows that a man can run a mile in under three
minutes.
</p>
<p>
Before dismissing them, however, let us note that these num-
bers, although not for strictly comparable problems, suggest that
effort goes as a power of size even when no communication is
involved except that of a man with his memories.
</p>
<p>
It illustrates results reported from
a study done by Nanus and Farr<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.7" href="#fn-.7">7</a></sup> at System Development Corpo-
ration. This shows an exponent of 1.5; that is,
</p>
<p>
effort = (constant) X (number of instructions)<sup>1</sup>.5.
</p>
<p>
Another SDC study reported by Weinwurm3 also shows an expo-
nent near 1.5.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">

<p>Since size is such a large part of the user cost of a programming
system product, the builder must set size targets, control size, and
devise size-reduction techniques, just as the hardware builder sets
component-count targets, controls component count, and devises
count-reduction techniques. Like any cost, size itself is not bad,
but unnecessary size is.

<p>First, setting size targets for core is not enough; one has to
budget all aspects of size. 
</p>
<p>
So the second moral is also clear: Define exactly what a
module must do when you specify how big it must be.
</p>
<p>
A third and deeper lesson shows through these experiences.
All during implementation, the
system architects must maintain continual vigilance to ensure con-
tinued system integrity. Beyond this policing mechanism, how-
ever, lies the matter of attitude of the implementers themselves.
Fostering a total-system, user-oriented attitude may well be the
most important function of the programming manager.

<h3 id="sec-9-3">Space Techniques</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">

<p>Obviously, more function means more space, speed being held
constant. So the first area of craftsmanship is in trading function
for size. One can design
a program with many optional features, each of which takes a little
space. One can design a generator that will take an option Jist and
tailor a program to it. So the designer must decide how fine-grained the user
choice of options will be.
</p>
<p>
The second area of craftsmanship is space-time trade-offs. For
a given function, the more space, the faster. This is true over an
amazingly large range. It is this fact that makes it feasible to set
space budgets.
</p>
<p>
The manager can do two things to help his team make good
space-time trade-offs. One is to ensure that they are trained in
programming technique, not just left to rely on native wit and
previous experience.
</p>
<p>
The second is to recognize that programming has a technol-
ogy, and components need to be fabricated. Every project needs
a notebook full of good subroutines or macros for queuing, search-
ing, hashing, and sorting. For each such function the notebook
should have at least two programs, the quick and the squeezed.

Two notions are important here. The first is control, the idea

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-1">

<ul>
<li id="sec-13-1-1">Bug-proofing the definition.<br/>
The most pernicious and subtle bugs are
  system bugs arising from mismatched assumptions made by the authors
  of various components. Careful function definition, careful
  specification, and the disciplined exorcism of frills of function
  and flights of technique all reduce the number of system bugs that
  have to be found.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-1-2">Testing the specification.<br/>
 Long before any code exists, the spec-
  ification must be handed to an outside testing group to be scruti-
  nized for completeness and clarity.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-1-3">Top-down design.<br/>
 Niklaus Wirth formalized a design procedure which
  had been used for years by the best programmers.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.11" href="#fn-.11">11</a></sup> Briefly,
  Wirth's procedure is to identify design as a sequence of refinement
  steps. 

<p>
From this process one identifies modules of solution or of
  data whose further refinement can proceed independently of other
  work. The degree of this modularity determines the adaptability and
  changeability of the program.
</p>
<p>
A good top-down design avoids bugs in several ways. First, the clarity
of structure and representation makes the precise state- ment of
requirements and functions of the modules easier. Second, the
partitioning and independence of modules avoids system bugs. Third,
the suppression of detail makes flaws in the structure more apparent.
Fourth, the design can be tested at each of its refinement steps, so
testing can start earlier and focus on the proper level of detail at
each step.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-1-4">Structured programming.<br/>
Another important set of new ideas for designing the bugs out of
programs derives largely from Dijkstra<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.12" href="#fn-.12">12</a></sup>, and is built on a theoretical
structure by Bohm and Jacopini<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.13" href="#fn-.13">13</a></sup>. 

<p>
The important point, and the one vital to constructing bug- free
programs, is that one wants to think about the control struc- tures of
a system as control structures, not as individual branch statements.
This way of thinking is a major step forward.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-13-3">

<p>The unexpectedly hard part of building a programming system is
system test. one should
be convinced of two things: system debugging will take longer
than one expects, and its difficulty justifies a thoroughly system-
atic and planned approach. Let us now see what such an approach
involves.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.14" href="#fn-.14">14</a></sup>
</p><ul>
<li id="sec-13-3-1">Use debugged components.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-3-2">Build plenty of scaffolding.<br/>
By scaffolding I mean all programs and data built for debugging
purposes but never intended to be in the final product.

<p>
One form of scaffolding is the dummy component, which con- sists only
of interfaces and perhaps some faked data or some small test cases. 
</p>
<p>
Another form is the miniature file. A very common form of system bug
is misunderstanding of formats for tape and disk files. So it is
worthwhile to build some little files that have only a few typical
records, but all the descriptions, pointers, etc.
</p>
<p>
Yet another form of scaffolding are auxiliary programs. Gener- ators
for test data, special analysis printouts, cross-reference table
analyzers, are all examples of the special-purpose jigs and fixtures
one may want to build.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr-.15" href="#fn-.15">15</a></sup>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-3-3">Control changes.<br/>
Tight control during test is one of the impres- sive techniques of
hardware debugging, and it applies as well to software systems.

<p>
First, somebody must be in charge. He and he alone must authorize
component changes or substitution of one version for another.
</p>
<p>
Then, as discussed above, there must be controlled copies of the
system: one locked-up copy of the latest versions, used for component
testing; one copy under test, with fixes being installed; playpen
copies where each man can work away on his component, doing both fixes
and extensions.
</p>
<p>
Programming needs a purple-wire technique, and it badly needs tight
control and deep respect for the paper that ultimately is the product.
The vital ingredients of such technique are the logging of all changes
in a journal and the distinction, carried conspicuously in source
code, between quick patches and thought-through, tested, documented
fixes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-3-4">Add one component at a time.<br/>
Note that one must have thorough test cases, testing the par- tial systems after each new piece is added. And the old ones, run successfully on the last partial sum, must be rerun on the new one
to test for system regression.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-13-3-5">Quantize updates.<br/>
The replacement of a working component by a new version requires the
same systematic testing procedure that adding a new component does,
although it should require less time, for more complete and efficient
test cases will usually be available.

<p>
But the changes need to be quantized. Then each user has periods of
productive stability, interrupted by bursts of test-bed change. This
seems to be much less disruptive than a constant rippling and
trembling

</p><ul>
<li id="sec-14-3-1">Reducing the role conflict.<br/>
The boss must first distinguish be-
tween action information and status information. He must disci-
pline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve, and
never to act on problems when he is explicitly reviewing status. 

<p>
This whole process is helped if the boss labels meetings, re-
views, conferences, as status-review meetings versus problem-action
meetings, and controls himself accordingly.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-1">

<p>To use a program. Every user needs a prose description of the
program. Most documentation fails in giving too little overview.
The trees are described, the bark and leaves are commented, but
there is no map of the forest. To write a useful prose description,
stand way back and come in slowly:
</p><ol>
<li>Purpose. What is the main function, the reason for the program?
</li>
<li>Environment. On what machines, hardware configurations, and
   operating system configurations will it run?
</li>
<li>Domain and range. What domain of input is valid? What range of
   output can legitimately appear?
</li>
<li>Functions realized and algorithms used. Precisely what does it do?
</li>
<li>Input-output formats,, precise and complete.
</li>
<li>Operating instructions, including normal and abnormal ending
   behavior, as seen at the console and on the outputs.
</li>
<li>Options. What choices does the user have about functions? Exactly
   how are those choices specified?
</li>
<li>Running time. How long does it take to do a problem of specified
   size on a specified configuration?
</li>
<li>Accuracy and checking. How precise are the answers expected to be?
   What means of checking accuracy are incorporated?
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li id="sec-15-1-1">To believe a program.<br/>
Then one needs more thorough test cases, which are normally
run only after a program is modified. These fall into three parts of
the input data domain:
<ol>
<li>Mainline cases that test the program's chief functions for commonly
   encountered data.
</li>
<li>Barely legitimate cases that probe the edge of the input data
   domain, ensuring that largest possible values, smallest possible
   values, and all kinds of valid exceptions work.
</li>
<li>Barely illegitimate cases that probe the domain boundary from the
   other side, ensuring that invalid inputs raise proper diagnostic
   messages.
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-15-1-2">To modify a program.<br/>
For the modifier, as well as the more casual user, the crying need is for a
clear, sharp overview, this time of the internal structure. What are
the components of such an overview?
<ol>
<li>A flow chart or subprogram structure graph. More on this later.
</li>
<li>Complete descriptions of the algorithms used, or else references to such descriptions in the literature.
</li>
<li>An explanation of the layout of all files used.
</li>
<li>An overview of the pass structure—the sequence in which data or
   programs are brought from tape or disk—and what is accomplished on
   each pass.
</li>
<li>A discussion of modifications contemplated in the original design,
   the nature and location of hooks and exits, and discursive
   discussion of the ideas of the original author about what
   modifications might be desirable and how one might proceed. His
   observations on hidden pitfalls are also useful.

<h3 id="sec-15-3">Self-Documenting Programs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-3">

<p>The solution, I think, is to merge the files, to incorporate the
documentation in the source program. This is at once a powerful
incentive toward proper maintenance, and an insurance that the
documentation will always be handy to the program user. Such
programs are called self-documenting.
</p>
<p>
An approach. The first notion is to use the parts of the program
that have to be there anyway, for programming language reasons,
to carry as much of the documentation as possible. So labels,
declaration statements, and symbolic names are all harnessed to
the task of conveying as much meaning as possible to the reader.
</p>
<p>
A second notion is to use space and format as much as possible
to improve readability and show subordination and nesting.
</p>
<p>
The third notion is to insert the necessary prose documenta-
tion into the program as paragraphs of comment. Most programs
tend to have enough line-by-line comments; those programs pro-
duced to meet stiff organizational standards for "good documenta-
tion" often have too many. 
</p>
<p>
Why not? What are the drawbacks of such an approach to docu-
mentation? There are several, which have been real but are becom-
ing imaginary with changing times.
</p>
<p>
The most serious objection is the increase in the size of the
source code that must be stored. 
</p>
<p>
Yet simultaneously we are moving also toward on-line storage
of prose documents for access and for updating via computerized
text-editing. As shown above, amalgamating prose and program
reduces the total number of characters to be stored.

<p>There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even
one order of magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in
simplicity.
</p>
<p>
The first step toward the management of disease was replacement of demon theories and humours theories by the germ
theory. That very step, the beginning of hope, in itself dashed
all hopes of magical solutions. It told workers that progress
would be made stepwise, at great effort, and that a persistent,
unremitting care would have to be paid to a discipline of clean-
liness. So it is with software engineering today.

<div id="outline-container-16-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-16-3">Does It Have to Be Hard?—Essential Difficulties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-16-3">

<p>First, we must observe that the anomaly is not that software
progress is so slow but that computer hardware progress is so
fast. No other technology since civilization began has seen six
orders of magnitude price-performance gain in 30 years. In no
other technology can one choose to take the gain in either improved performance or in reduced costs. These gains flow from
the transformation of computer manufacture from an assembly
industry into a process industry.
</p>
<p>
Second, to see what rate of progress we can expect in software
technology, let us examine its difficulties. Following Aristotle, I
divide them into essence&ndash;the difficulties inherent in the
nature of the software&ndash;and accidents—-those difficulties that today
attend its production but that are not inherent.
</p>
<p>
The essence of a software entity is a construct of interlocking
concepts: data sets, relationships among data items, algorithms,
and invocations of functions. This essence is abstract, in that the
conceptual construct is the same under many different representations. It is nonetheless highly precise and richly detailed.
</p>
<p>
I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification,
design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation. We still make
syntax errors, to be sure; but they are fuzz compared to the conceptual errors in most systems.
</p>
<p>
If this is true, building software will always be hard. There is inherently no silver bullet.
</p>
<p>
Let us consider the inherent properties of this irreducible
essence of modern software systems: complexity, conformity,
changeability, and invisibility.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="sec-16-3-1">Complexity.<br/>
  Software entities are more complex for their size than
  perhaps any other human construct, because no two parts are alike
  (at least above the statement level). If they are, we make the two
  similar parts into one, a subroutine, open or closed.

<p>
Likewise, a scaling-up of a software entity is not merely a
repetition of the same elements in larger size; it is necessarily an
increase in the number of different elements. In most cases, the
elements interact with each other in some nonlinear fashion,
and the complexity of the whole increases much more than lin-
early.
</p>
<p>
Many of the classical problems of developing software prod-
ucts derive from this essential complexity and its nonlinear in-
creases with size. From the complexity comes the difficulty
of communication among team members, which leads to prod-
uct flaws, cost overruns, schedule delays. From the complexity
comes the difficulty of enumerating, much less understanding,
all the possible states of the program, and from that comes the
unreliability. From the complexity of the functions comes the
difficulty of invoking those functions, which makes programs
hard to use. From complexity of structure comes the difficulty
of extending programs to new functions without creating side
effects. From complexity of structure comes the unvisualized
states that constitute security trapdoors.
</p>
<p>
Not only technical problems but management problems as
well come from the complexity. This complexity makes overview hard, thus impeding conceptual integrity. It makes it hard
to find and control all the loose ends. It creates the tremendous
learning and understanding burden that makes personnel turnover a disaster.
</p>


</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-16-3-2">Conformity.<br/>
Einstein repeatedly argued
that there must be simplified explanations of nature, because
God is not capricious or arbitrary.

<p>
No such faith comforts the software engineer. Much of the
complexity he must master is arbitrary complexity, forced with-
out rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which his interfaces must conform. These differ from
interface to interface, and from time to time, not because of
necessity but only because they were designed by different people,
rather than by God.
</p>
<p>
In many cases the software must conform because it has
most recently come to the scene. In others it must conform be-
cause it is perceived as the most conformable. But in all cases,
much complexity comes from conformation to other interfaces;
this cannot be simplified out by any redesign of the software
alone.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-16-3-3">Changeability.<br/>
The software entity is constantly subject to
pressures for change.

<p>
Partly this is because the software in a system embodies its
function, and the function is the part that most feels the pressures
of change. Partly it is because software can be changed more easily—it
is pure thought-stuff, infinitely malleable. Buildings do in fact get
changed, but the high costs of change, understood by all, serve to
dampen the whims of the changers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li id="sec-16-3-4">Invisibility.<br/>
Software is invisible and unvisualizable.

<p>
As soon as we attempt to diagram soft-
ware structure, we find it to constitute not one, but several,
general directed graphs, superimposed one upon another. The
several graphs may represent the flow of control, the flow of
data, patterns of dependency, time sequence, name-space rela-
tionships. These are usually not even planar, much less hier-
archical. Indeed, one of the ways of establishing conceptual
control over such structure is to enforce link cutting until one or
more of the graphs becomes hierarchical.
</p>
<p>
In spite of progress in restricting and simplifying the structures of software, they remain inherently unvisualizable, thus
depriving the mind of some of its most powerful conceptual
tools. This lack not only impedes the process of design within
one mind, it severely hinders communication among minds.
