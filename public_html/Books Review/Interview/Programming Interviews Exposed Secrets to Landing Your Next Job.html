<h3 id="sec-1-1">Develop Marketable Skills</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The appendix covers how your résumé is primarily a marketing tool to
get you job interviews. This assumes, of course, that you have
marketable skills to offer a prospective employer. You can only
stretch the truth so far, and if even you exaggerate or outright lie
about your skills and what you’ve accomplished in the past, you
probably won’t make it through technical interviews designed
specifically to weed out the liars and exaggerators of this world.
What you need to do, then, is develop skills and accomplishments that
will make you stand out from the crowd both on paper and in the
interviews, especially if you’re entering the job market for the first
time. Here are some approaches you can take:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Upgrade your credentials - Companies such as Google are well known
for favoring job applicants with graduate degrees. Getting a
master’s or doctorate degree is one way to upgrade your credentials.
Although pursuing a graduate degree is a large commitment on your
part, you can upgrade your credentials in other ways, such as taking
university or professional development courses or participating in
programming contests. 
</li>
<li>Get certified - Certification is a touchy
issue in the software development profession, but there’s no doubt
that some jobs either prefer or require candidates to be certified
in specific technologies, especially IT jobs. 
</li>
<li>Work on a side project - A great way to expand your skill set is to
work on a project that is not directly related to your primary work
or study focus. Starting or joining an open-source development
project is one way to go. Or if you’re working at a company, see if
they’ll let you spend time on an ancillary project.
</li>

<li>Do well in school - Although grades aren’t everything, they are one
measure that companies use in order to rank new graduates with
little job experience. The better your grades, especially in
computer science and mathematics courses, the more you’ll impress a
potential employer.
</li>

<li>Keep learning - The end of formal education doesn’t mean you should
stop learning, especially when there’s so much information about
programming available from a wide variety of sources. Whether it’s
books or blogs, there’s always a way to keep yourself current, no
matter what type of programming you do. It’s also a great way to
expand your horizons and discover other areas of interest.
</li>

<li>Be an intern - New graduates who’ve managed to secure employment
during their nonschool terms - especially those that participate in
cooperative education programs - have a huge leg up over their peers
who haven’t yet ventured into the real world. Software development
in the field is often very different from software development in an
academic setting, and potential employers are very cognizant of
this.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The key is to keep learning, no matter what stage of your career
you’re at. Marketable skills don’t develop overnight; they take some
effort and initiative on your part, but they’ll have long-lasting
effects on your career.
</p>

<p>
Note that one of the best ways to develop marketable skills is to
accomplish something, whether it’s in your current job, something you
did as a side project, or something you worked on as an intern or for
a class project. Being able to talk intelligently and confidently
about a project for which you played a primary role in its success is
incredibly important. Make sure you can describe the problem clearly
and succinctly and how your project solved the problem, even to a
nontechnical person. Displaying a passion for programming is always
positive and one way to make yourself stand out from the other
candidates.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">Interactivity Is Key</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The code you write in the interview is probably the only example of
your code that your interviewer will see. If you write ugly code, your
interviewer will assume you always write ugly code. This is your
chance to shine and show your best code. Take the time to make your
code solid and pretty.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Tip Brush up on the languages you expect to use, and write your best code.</b>
Programming questions are designed to see both how well you can code
and how you solve problems. If all the interviewer wanted to do were
measure your coding ability, he could give you a piece of paper with
problems and come back an hour later to evaluate how you did, just as
they do in programming contests. What the interviewer wants is to see
your thought processes as you work through each stage of the
programming problem.
</p>

<p>
The problem-solving process in these interviews is very interactive,
and if you’re having difficulty, the interviewer will generally guide
you to the correct answer via a series of hints. Of course, the less
help you need to solve the problem, the better you look, but showing
an intelligent thought process and responding well to the hints you
are given is also very important.
</p>

<p>
Even when you immediately know the answer to a problem, because it’s
something you’ve already done before, don’t just blurt it out. Break
the answer down into discrete steps and explain the thought processes
behind each step. The point is to show the interviewer that you
understand the underlying concepts, not that you’ve managed to
memorize the answer to a programming puzzle.
</p>

<p>
If you know any additional information pertaining to the problem, you
may want to mention it during the process to show your general
knowledge of programming, even if it’s not directly applicable to the
problem at hand. In answering these problems, show that you’re not
just a propeller-head coder. Demonstrate that you have logical thought
processes, are generally knowledgeable about computers, and can
communicate well.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tip Keep talking! Always explain what you are doing! Otherwise, the interviewer has no way of knowing how you tackle complex programming problems.</b>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Solving the Questions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Now it’s time to solve the questions, but don’t just jump in. Instead,
remember you want to fully understand the problem. You should try an
example, and then focus on the algorithm that will solve the problem.
You then want to explain your solution and code for the solution. The
following steps walk you through the process:
</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul"><li>The Basic Steps<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-1">
<p>
The best way to solve an interview problem is to approach it
methodically. Here are the suggested steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make sure you understand the problem. Your initial assumptions
about the problem may be wrong, or the interviewer’s explanation
may be very brief or difficult to follow. You can’t demonstrate
your skills if you don’t understand the problem. Don’t hesitate to
ask your interviewer questions about the problem, and don’t start
solving it until you understand it. The interviewer may be
deliberately obscuring things in order to determine whether you can
find and understand the real problem.
</li>

<li>Once you understand the question, try an example. This example may
lead to insights about how to solve the problem or bring to light
any remaining misunderstandings that you have. Starting with an
example also demonstrates a methodical, logical thought process.
Examples are especially useful if you don’t see the solution right
away.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Tip         Make sure you understand the problem before you start solving it, and then start with an example to solidify your understanding.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Focus on the algorithm you will use to solve the problem. Often,
this will take a long time and require additional examples. This is
to be expected. Interactivity is important during this process. If
you stand quietly staring at the whiteboard, the interviewer has no
way of knowing whether you’re making productive headway or are
simply clueless. Talk to your interviewer and tell him or her what
you are doing. For example, you might say something like, “I’m
wondering whether I can store the values in an array and then sort
them, but I don’t think that will work because I can’t quickly look
up elements in an array by value.” This demonstrates your skill,
which is the point of the interview, and may also lead to hints
from the interviewer, who might respond, “You’re very close to the
solution. Do you really need to look up elements by value, or could
you …”

<p>
 It may take a long time to solve the problem, and you may be
tempted to begin coding before you figure out an exact solution.
Resist this temptation. Consider who you would rather work with:
someone who thinks about a problem for a long time and then codes
it correctly the first time or someone who hastily jumps into a
problem, makes several errors while coding, and doesn’t have any
idea where he or she is going. Not a difficult decision, is it?
</p>
</li>

<li>After you’ve figured out your algorithm and how you will implement
it, explain your solution to the interviewer. This gives him or her
an opportunity to evaluate your solution before you begin coding.
Your interviewer may say, “Sounds great, go ahead and code it,” or
something like, “That’s not quite right because you can’t look up
elements in a hash table that way.” In either case, you gain
valuable information.
</li>

<li>While you code, it’s important to explain what you’re doing. For
example, you might say, “Here, I’m initializing the array to all
zeroes.” This narrative enables the interviewer to follow your code
more easily.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Tip         Explain what you are doing to your interviewer before and
while coding the solution. Keep talking!
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ask questions when necessary. You generally won’t be penalized for
asking factual questions that you might otherwise look up in a
reference. You obviously can’t ask a question like, “How do I solve
this problem?” but it is acceptable to ask a question like, “I
can’t remember - what format string do I use to print out a
localized date?” While it’s better to know these things, it’s okay
to ask this sort of question.
</li>

<li>After you’ve written the code for a problem, immediately verify
that the code is correct by tracing through it with an example.
This step demonstrates very clearly that your code works in at
least one case. It also illustrates a logical thought process and
your desire to check your work and search for bugs. The example may
also help you flush out minor bugs in your solution.
</li>

<li>Make sure you check your code for all error and special cases,
especially boundary conditions. Many error and special cases are
overlooked by programmers; forgetting these cases in an interview
indicates you may forget them on the job. For example, if you
allocate memory dynamically, make sure you check that the
allocation did not fail. (If time does not allow for extensive
checking, at the very least explain that you should check for such
failures.) Covering error and special cases will impress your
interviewer and help you correctly solve the problem.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Tip Try an example, and check all error and special cases.
</p>

<p>
Once you try an example and feel comfortable that your code is
correct, the interviewer may ask you questions about what you wrote.
Commonly, these questions focus on running time, alternative
implementations, and complexity. If your interviewer does not ask you
these questions, you should volunteer the information to show that you
are cognizant of these issues. For example, you could say, “This
implementation has linear running time, which is the best possible
because I have to check all the input values. The dynamic memory
allocation will slow it down a little, as will the overhead of using
recursion.”
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>When You Get Stuck<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">
<p>
Getting stuck on a problem is expected and an important part of the
interviewing process. Interviewers want to see how you respond when
you don’t recognize the answer to a question immediately. Giving up or
getting frustrated is the worst thing to do if this happens to you.
Instead, show interest in the problem and keep trying to solve it:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Go back to an example. Try performing the task and analyzing what
you are doing. Try extending from your specific example to the
general case. You may have to use very detailed examples. This is
okay, because it shows the interviewer your persistence in finding
the correct solution.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tip          When all else fails, return to a specific example. Try to move from the specific example to the general case and from there to the solution.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try a different data structure. Perhaps a linked list, an array, a
hash table, or a binary search tree will help. If you’re given an
unusual data structure, look for similarities between it and
more-familiar data structures. Using the right data structure often
makes a problem much easier.
</li>

<li>Consider the less-commonly used or more-advanced aspects of a
language. Sometimes the key to a problem involves one of these
features.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tip         Sometimes a different data structure or advanced language feature is key to the solution.
</p>

<p>
Even when you don’t feel stuck, you may be having problems. You may be
missing an elegant or obvious way to implement something and writing
too much code. Almost all interview coding questions have short
answers. You rarely need to write more than 15 lines of code and
almost never more than 30. If you start writing a lot of code, you may
be heading in the wrong direction.

</div><ul class="org-ul"><li>Breadth-First Search<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-1">
<p>
One way to search a tree is to do a breadth-first search (BFS). In a
BFS you start with the root, move left to right across the second
level, then move left to right across the third level, and so forth.
You continue the search until either you have examined all of the
nodes or you find the node you are searching for. The time to find a
node is O(n), so this type of search is best avoided for large trees.
A BFS also uses a large amount of memory because it is necessary to
track the child nodes for all nodes on a given level while searching
that level.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Depth-First Search<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-2-2">
<p>
Another common way to search for a node is by using a depth-first
search (DFS). A depth-first search follows one branch of the tree down
as many levels as possible until the target node is found or the end
is reached. When the search can’t go down any farther, it is continued
at the nearest ancestor with unexplored children. DFS has much lower
memory requirements than BFS because it is not necessary to store all
of the child pointers at each level. In addition, DFS has the
advantage that it doesn’t examine any single level last (BFS examines
the lowest level last). This is useful if you suspect that the node
you are searching for will be in the lower levels. For example, if you
were searching a job hierarchy tree looking for an employee who
started less than three months ago, you would suspect that lower-level
employees are more likely to have started recently. In this case, if
the assumption were true, a DFS would usually find the target node
more quickly than a BFS.

<h3 id="sec-6-3">Array and String Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">
<p>
Both hash tables and arrays provide constant-time lookup; you need to
decide which one you will use. On the one hand, hash tables have a
higher lookup overhead than arrays. On the other hand, an array would
initially contain random values that you would have to take time to
set to zero, whereas a hash table initially has no values. Perhaps the
greatest difference is in memory requirements. An array would need an
element for every possible value of a character. This would amount to
a relatively reasonable 128 elements if you were processing ASCII
strings, but if you had to process Unicode strings you would need more
than 65,000 elements, assuming a 16-bit Unicode encoding. In contrast,
a hash table would require storage for only the characters that
actually exist in the input string. Therefore, arrays are a better
choice for long strings with a limited set of possible character
values; hash tables are more efficient for shorter strings or when
there are many possible character values.

<h2 id="sec-7">Chapter 7: Recursion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Although recursion is a very powerful technique, it is not always the
best approach, and rarely is it the most efficient approach. This is
due to the relatively large overhead for routine calls on most
platforms. For a simple recursive routine like factorial, many
computer architectures spend more time on call overhead than the
actual calculation. Iterative routines, which use looping constructs
instead of recursive routine calls, do not suffer from this overhead
and are frequently more efficient.
</p>

<p>
Tip Iterative solutions are usually more efficient than recursive solutions.
</p>

<p>
This implementation is significantly more efficient than our previous
recursive implementation because no routine calls are involved.
Although it represents a different way of thinking about the problem,
it’s not really any more difficult to write than the recursive
implementation
</p>


<p>
Tip         
A recursive algorithm can be implemented without recursive calls by
using a stack, but it’s usually more trouble than it’s worth.
</p>

<p>
In an interview, a working solution is of primary importance; an
efficient solution is secondary. Unless you’ve been told otherwise, go
with whatever type of working solution comes to you first. If it’s a
recursive solution, you might want to mention the inefficiencies
inherent in recursive solutions to your interviewer, so it’s clear
that you know about them. In the rare instance that you see a
recursive solution and an iterative solution of roughly equal
complexity, you should probably mention them both to the interviewer,
indicating that you’re going to work out the iterative solution
because it’s likely to be more efficient.

A thread is the fundamental unit of execution within an application: A
running application consists of at least one thread. Each thread has
its own stack and runs independently from the application’s other
threads. Threads share the resources used by the application as it
runs, such as file handles or memory, which is why problems can occur.
Data corruption is a common side effect of having two threads
simultaneously write data to the same block of memory, for example.

One solution is to add a timeout to the waiting: If a philosopher is

interfaces can be used in non-OO programming models, such as
componentbased models like COM and CORBA. However, you’re focusing on
the use of interfaces in an object-oriented context, where they are
useful in their own right. Interfaces are the ultimate encapsulators,
because they hide all the details of the classes that implement their
methods from the user of the interface. They’re particularly
important - almost necessary, in fact - in languages that only support
single inheritance (classes can only inherit from one base class). A
class that exposes its members via an interface is said to implement
the interface.
</p>

<p>
Unlike an interface, an abstract class is a proper class: It can have
data members and can be a subclass of other classes. Unlike a concrete
(nonabstract) class, however, some of its behaviors are deliberately
left to be defined by its own subclasses. Abstract classes cannot be
instantiated because of this - only instances of concrete subclasses
can be created.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
Describe what virtual methods are and why they are useful.
</p>

<p>
A virtual method is a method whose implementation is determined at run
time based on the actual type (class) of the invoking object.
Nonstatic Java methods are always virtual, so Java programmers may
have trouble answering this one; but in C# and C++, methods are only
virtual when declared with the virtual keyword - nonvirtual methods
are the default.
</p>

<p>
Once you explain what virtual methods are and why they’re useful, talk
about their advantages and disadvantages. The primary advantage was
just described: the run-time method selection. Virtual methods are
also used to declare abstract methods. The disadvantages are that it
takes longer to invoke a virtual method (at a minimum, one lookup
needs to be done in a table to find the right method - you can’t jump
directly to the method as you can with nonvirtuals) and that extra
memory is required to store the information needed for the lookup.

<h3 id="sec-9-3">Multiple Inheritance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
Why do C# and Java disallow the multiple inheritance of classes?
</p>

<p>
In C++ it’s legal for a class to inherit (directly or indirectly) from
more than one class, which is referred to as multiple inheritance. C#
and Java, however, limit classes to single inheritance - each class
inherits from a single parent class.
</p>

<p>
Multiple inheritance is a useful way to create classes that combine
aspects of two disparate class hierarchies, something that often
happens when using different class frameworks within a single
application. If two frameworks define their own base classes for
exceptions, for example, you can use multiple inheritance to create
exception classes that can be used with either framework.
</p>

<p>
The problem with multiple inheritance is that it can lead to
ambiguity. The classic example is when a class inherits from two other
classes, each of which inherits from the same class:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-c++"> <span style="color: #00ffff;">class</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">A</span> {
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">protected</span>:
    <span style="color: #98fb98;">bool</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">flag</span>;
};

<span style="color: #00ffff;">class</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">B</span> : <span style="color: #00ffff;">public</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">A</span> {};

<span style="color: #00ffff;">class</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">C</span> : <span style="color: #00ffff;">public</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">A</span> {};

<span style="color: #00ffff;">class</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">D</span> : <span style="color: #00ffff;">public</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">B</span>, <span style="color: #00ffff;">public</span> <span style="color: #98fb98;">C</span> {
  <span style="color: #00ffff;">public</span>:
    <span style="color: #98fb98;">void</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">setFlag</span>( <span style="color: #98fb98;">bool</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">nflag</span> ){
        flag = nflag; <span style="color: #ff7f24;">// </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">ambiguous</span>
    }
};
</pre>
</div>
<p>
In this example, the flag data member is defined by class A. But class
D descends from class B and class C, which both derive from A, so in
essence two copies of flag are available because there are two
instances of A in D’s class hierarchy. Which one do you want to set?
The compiler will complain that the reference to flag in D is
ambiguous. One fix is to explicitly disambiguate the reference:
</p>

<p>
<code>B::flag = nflag;</code>
</p>

<p>
Another fix is to declare B and C as virtual base classes, which means
that only one copy of A will exist in the hierarchy, eliminating any
ambiguity.
</p>


<p>
There are other complexities with multiple inheritance, such as the
order in which the base classes are initialized when a derived object
is constructed, or the way members can be inadvertently hidden from
derived classes. Because of these complexities, some languages
restrict themselves to the much simpler single inheritance model. On
the other hand, single inheritance is also very restrictive, because
only classes with a common ancestor can share behaviors. Interfaces
mitigate this restriction somewhat by allowing classes in different
hierarchies to expose common interfaces even if they’re not
implemented by sharing code.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-1">
<p>
Data in a relational database is stored in tables, which consist of
rows and columns. (A set of tables is referred to as a schema.) Each
table has at least one column, but there may be no rows. Each column
has a type associated with it, which limits the type of data that can
be stored in the column, as well as additional constraints. Although
the columns are ordered, the rows aren’t. Any ordering that is
required is done when the data is fetched (via a query) from the
database.
</p>

<p>
Most tables have keys, although it’s not a requirement (but it is good
design). A key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies
a particular row in the table. One of the keys is designated to be the
primary key. For example, in a table of employees, you would use the
employee identification number - guaranteed to be unique for each
employee - as the primary key.
</p>

<p>
A table can be linked to another table using a foreign key. A foreign
key is usually a primary key value taken from the other table. Foreign
keys ensure that data isn’t deleted prematurely: You can’t delete a
row from a table if the foreign key of another table references the
row. This is known as referential integrity, and it ensures that
related tables are always in a consistent state with respect to each
other.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-3">
<p>
The integrity of the data stored in a database is paramount: If the
data is ever corrupted, every application that depends on the database
may fail or be in error. While referential integrity helps keep the
data consistent, the best way to ensure data integrity is to use a
database transaction.
</p>

<p>
A transaction groups a set of related database manipulations together
into a single unit. If any operation within the transaction fails, the
entire transaction fails and any changes made by the transaction are
abandoned (rolled back). Conversely, if all the operations succeed,
then all the changes are committed together as a group.
</p>

<p>
The four properties of a transaction are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Atomicity - The database system guarantees that either all
operations with the transaction succeed or else they all fail.
</li>

<li>Consistency - The transaction must ensure that the database is in a
correct, consistent state at the start and the end of the
transaction. No referential integrity constraints can be broken, for
example.
</li>

<li>Isolation - All changes to the database within a transaction are
isolated from all other queries and transactions until the
transaction is committed.
</li>

<li>Durability - Once committed, changes made in a transaction are
permanent. The database system must have some way to recover from
crashes and other problems so that the current state of the database
is never lost.

There is one minor bug in this query. If the maximum value is repeated

The trick is in the use of the equality operator (‘=’) to test for a

UNKNOWN - even when comparing NULL to NULL. The proper way to check

</li>
<li>A’s LR’s y value is greater than B’s UL’s y value.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This solution is much simpler, requiring only four comparisons and one
negation. You can implement the function as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #98fb98;">boolean</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">overlap</span>( <span style="color: #98fb98;">Rect</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">Rect</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">b</span> ){

              a.lr.y &gt; b.ul.y );
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Working through these rules, you’ll get the following function:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #98fb98;">boolean</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">overlap</span>( <span style="color: #98fb98;">Rect</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">a</span>, <span style="color: #98fb98;">Rect</span> <span style="color: #eedd82;">b</span>){
    <span style="color: #00ffff;">return</span>( a.ul.x &lt;= b.lr.x &amp;&amp;
            a.ul.y &gt;= b.lr.y &amp;&amp;

            a.lr.y &lt;= b.ul.y );
}
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To ensure that you didn’t make a mistake, it’s a good idea to verify
that these conditions make sense. The preceding function determines
that two rectangles overlap if
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A’s left edge is to the left of B’s right edge and
</li>
<li>A’s upper edge is above B’s bottom edge and
</li>
<li>A’s right edge is to the right of B’s left edge and

<li>A’s bottom edge is below B’s upper edge.

Endianness is important to know when reading or writing data
structures, especially across networks, so that different applications
can communicate with each other. Sometimes the endianness is hidden
from the developer: Java uses a fixed endianness to store data,
regardless of the underlying platform’s endianness, so data exchanges
between two Java applications won’t normally be affected by
endianness. But other languages, C in particular, don’t specify an
endianness for data storage, leaving the implementation free to choose
the endianness that works best for the platform. C is used to solve
this problem.

Write a function that determines the number of 1 bits in the
computer’s internal representation of a given integer.
</p>

<p>
The number will be shifted to the right, but the new bit added on the
left will depend on how the shift operator treats negative values.
Let’s avoid the problem entirely and use Java’s &gt;&gt;&gt; operator for our
example. In the other C-like languages, you can also avoid the problem
by reading the value as an unsigned integer. (That solution doesn’t
work with Java because there are no unsigned integer types in Java.)
Using either the &gt;&gt;&gt; or an unsigned integer means that the shift
operator will not sign extend, and the new bits that are added during
the right shifting will be 0’s. The number will eventually become all
0’s. Finally, consider the case where you are given a positive
integer. This is the sample case that you worked with, and the
algorithm works correctly here.

<p>
You can count the number of times that you can perform this process
before the integer’s value reaches 0. This is the number of 1’s in the

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
This property of brainteasers works most strongly to your advantage
when you are faced with a problem that has only two possible answers
(for example, any yes or no question). Whichever answer seems at first
to be correct is probably wrong. Of course, it’s probably not a good
idea to say, “The answer must be yes because if it were no this would
be a very simple problem and you wouldn’t have bothered to ask it.”
You can, however, use this knowledge to guide your thinking.
</p>

<p>
Tip Remember that the obvious answer is almost never the right answer.

<h3 id="sec-12-2">Solve the Right Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<p>
For example, suppose you are given the problem of finding an
arrangement that maximizes the number of oranges you can fit in the
bottom of a square box. You would probably automatically assume that
the oranges are small spherical fruit, that they are all about the
same size, that “in the bottom” means in contact with the bottom
surface of the box, and that the oranges must remain intact (you
can’t puree them and pour them in). These assumptions may seem
ridiculous - they are all rather obvious and they are all correct.
The point is that assumptions are inherent in all communication or
thought; you can’t begin to work on a problem without assumptions.
</p>


<p>
Tip         
If the solution that seems logical is wrong, you made a false
assumption. Categorize your assumptions, and try to identify those
that are false.

<h3 id="sec-12-4">Estimation Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-4">
<p>
One estimation problem is “How many gas stations are there in the
United States?” It has been so widely reported that this problem was
posed by Microsoft that it seems almost certain to be apocryphal;
nevertheless, it is a good example.
</p>

<p>
These problems are usually not difficult compared with the more common
brainteasers. You’re not expected to know the actual statistic or
fact. Instead, you are expected to do a rough order of magnitude
calculation based on facts you do know. Because everything is an
estimate anyway, try to adjust or round your figures so that any large
numbers you use are powers (or at least multiples) of ten - this will
significantly simplify your arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Taking the gas station problem as an example, your calculation might
go like this: “It takes me about six minutes to fill up my car. I go
to the gas station about once a week, and there are usually two other
cars there. If I assume this is average for Americans, each gas
station services about 30 cars an hour. Suppose a gas station were
open 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. That would be 84 hours a week. In
reality, a gas station is probably open more than 12 hours a day, so
I’ll say the average gas station is open 100 hours a week. That means
it services 3,000 cars a week. There’s somewhere upwards of 250
million people in the United States. Not everyone has a car, so
suppose there are 100 million cars on the road. If every car goes to
the gas station once a week, like mine does, and each station sees
3,000 cars a week, there would have to be about 33,000 gas stations in
the United States.” This figure is probably off by a lot, but it’s
likely within an order of magnitude (that is, there are more than
3,300 gas stations and fewer than 330,000). It’s much more important
that you are able to form a framework for the estimation and rapidly
work through the calculations than that you accurately estimate the
statistic. For more practice, try estimating the number of
kindergarten teachers in your state, the circumference of the earth,
and the weight of a ferry boat.

<h3 id="sec-14-1">C++ versus Java</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-1">
<p>
Important         
What are the differences between C++ and Java?
C++ and Java are syntactically very similar. Java’s designers intended
this to make it easy for C++ developers to learn Java. Apart from this
area of similarity, Java and C++ differ in a variety of ways, largely
because of their different design goals. Security, portability, and
rapid development were of paramount importance in the design of Java,
whereas C++ is more concerned with performance and backward
compatibility with C. Java is compiled to virtual machine byte-code
and requires a virtual machine to run; C++ is compiled to native
machine code. This usually makes C++ faster, but it gives Java greater
potential for portability and security.
</p>

<p>
C++ is a superset of C and maintains features such as
programmer-controlled memory management, pointers, and a preprocessor
for full backward compatibility with C. In contrast, Java eliminates
these and other bug-prone features. Java replaces programmer memory
deallocations with garbage collection. Java further dispenses with C++
features such as operator overloading and multiple inheritance. These
choices are seen by some to make Java a better choice for rapid
development and for projects where portability and security are more
important than performance.
</p>

<p>
Tip         
A limited form of multiple inheritance can be simulated in Java using
interfaces.
</p>

<p>
In Java, all objects are passed by reference, whereas in C++, the
default behavior is to pass objects by value. Java does not perform
automatic type casting as C++ does, though newer Java features such as
generics and autoboxing now handle many common cases. In Java, all
methods are virtual, meaning the implementation for a method is
selected according to the type of the object as opposed to the type of
the reference. In C++, methods must be explicitly declared as virtual.
Java has defined sizes for primitive data types, while type sizes are
implementation-dependent in C++ (and C).
</p>

<p>
In situations where there is legacy C code and a great need for
performance, C++ has certain benefits, especially when low-level
system access is required. In situations where portability, security,
and speed of development are emphasized, Java (or a similar language
such as C#) may be a better choice.

<div id="outline-container-sec-14-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-14-2">Garbage Collection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-2">
<p>
Important         
Discuss what garbage collection is and explain different ways it can
be implemented.
</p>

<p>
Garbage collection is the process by which a program automatically
finds and reclaims memory that is no longer used or no longer
accessible by an application. This reclamation occurs without
programmer assistance. C#, Java, Lisp, and Perl are examples of
languages with garbage-collection facilities.
</p>

<p>
Garbage collection provides several advantages over having a
programmer explicitly deallocate memory. It eliminates bugs due to
dangling pointers and memory leaks. It also promotes greater
simplicity in program and interface design because the complicated
mechanisms traditionally used to ensure that memory is properly freed
(such as “smart pointers” in C++) are unnecessary. In addition,
because programmers don’t have to worry about memory deallocation,
program development proceeds at a more rapid pace.
</p>

<p>
Garbage collection is not without its disadvantages, however.
Garbage-collected programs often run more slowly because of the
overhead needed for the system to determine when to deallocate and
reclaim memory no longer needed. In addition, the system will
occasionally over-allocate memory and may not free memory at the best
possible time.
</p>

<p>
One method of garbage collection is to use reference counting. This
involves tracking how many variables reference an object. Initially,
there will be one reference to a piece of memory. The reference count
will increase if the variable referencing it is copied. When a
variable referencing an object changes value or goes out of scope, the
object’s reference count is decremented. If a reference count ever
goes to 0, the memory associated with the object is freed: If no one
is keeping a reference to the object, then the object (and hence its
memory) is no longer needed.
</p>

<p>
Reference counting is simple and relatively fast. However, it doesn’t
handle circular references. Consider what happens in the case of a
circularly linked list with nothing external pointing to it. Every
element in the list has a nonzero reference count, yet the memory
isn’t referenced by any object outside the list itself. Thus, the
memory could safely be deallocated, but reference-based garbage
collection won’t free it.
</p>

<p>
A second method of garbage collection is known as mark and sweep. In
the first pass, the memory manager will mark all objects that can be
accessed by any thread in the program. In the second pass, all
unmarked objects are deallocated, or swept away.
</p>

<p>
Mark and sweep handles circular references, but it’s also less
efficient. The garbage collector runs at different points in an
application’s execution and may cause the application to pause while
the garbage collecting occurs.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-14-3">Network Performance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-3">
<p>
Important         
What are the two major issues in networking performance?
</p>

<p>
Any network can be measured by two major characteristics: latency and
bandwidth. Latency refers to how long it takes a given bit of
information to get through the network. Bandwidth refers to the rate
at which data moves through the network once communication is
established. The perfect network would have infinite bandwidth and no
latency.
</p>

<p>
A pipe is a good analog for a network. The time it takes for a
molecule of water to go through the whole pipe is determined by the
length; this is analogous to the latency. The width of the pipe
determines the bandwidth: how much water can pass in a given time.
</p>

<p>
Latency and bandwidth problems are often encountered when searching
the Web. If you wait a long time for a page to display and then it
appears quickly, this indicates good bandwidth but high latency. On
the other hand, if a page starts loading right away but takes a long
time to load, that is a symptom of a low-latency, low-bandwidth
connection.

<h3 id="sec-14-4">Hash Tables versus Binary Search Trees</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-14-4">
<p>
Important         
Compare and contrast a hash table and a binary search tree. If you
were designing the address book data structure for a personal digital
assistant (PDA) with limited memory, which one would you use?
</p>

<p>
A binary search tree can insert and retrieve in O(log(n)). This is
fast, though not as fast as a hash table’s O(1). A binary search tree,
however, also maintains its data in sorted order.
</p>

<p>
In a PDA, you want to keep as much memory as possible available for
data storage. If you use an unordered data structure such as a hash
table, you need additional memory to sort the values, as you
undoubtedly want to display the values in alphabetical order.
Therefore, if you use a hash table, you have to set aside memory for
sorting that could otherwise be used as storage space.
</p>

<p>
If you use a binary search tree, you won’t have to waste memory or
processing time on sorting records for display. Although binary tree
operations are slower than hash table operations, a device like this
is likely to have no more than about 10,000 entries, so a binary
search tree’s O(log(n)) lookup will undoubtedly be fast enough. For
these reasons, a binary search tree is better suited for this kind of
task than a hash table.

<h3 id="sec-15-1">“What Do You Want to Do?”</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-1">
<p>
Always pay attention to who is asking this question. If it’s a
human-resource representative scheduling interviews, be honest and
tell him what you want to do. The HR rep will generally use this
information to set up interviews with appropriate groups.
</p>

<p>
If you’re asked this question by a more-technical interviewer, watch
out! If you answer this question poorly, you won’t get an offer. These
interviewers ask this question partly because they want to find out
your goals and ambitions. If you want to do something different from
the job that is available, your interviewer will probably decide that
you should look for a different job. If you want the job, make sure
you indicate that you’re interested in doing it, sound sincere, and
give a reason. For example, you could say, “I’ve always been
interested in systems-level programming and really enjoy it, so I’m
hoping to join a large company and do systems-level work.” Or, you
could say, “I want to do Web programming so I can show my work to my
friends. I’m hoping to do this at a start-up where I can use my Web
server experience and watch the company grow.”
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, you may not be sure what specific kind of job you’re
interviewing for. In these cases, you can always fall back on
describing the company you’re applying to as the ideal company for
you. Mention that you’re hoping to do development that’s exciting and
provides a lot of opportunity to contribute and learn. You can say
that you see the work as just one part of the package; other important
parts are the team and the company. This sort of response shows that
you have your act together and prevents you from talking your way out
of a job.
</p>

<p>
There is a fine line between sounding enthusiastic and seeming
dateless and desperate. No one wants an employee who has been rejected
by everyone else. Make sure your answer never sounds like you’d be
happy to take any sort of job the company would be willing to offer.
This sort of response virtually guarantees nothing more than a “thank
you for coming in” letter.
</p>

<p>
It’s also possible that you know exactly what you want to do and
wouldn’t accept any other kind of job. If so, don’t talk yourself up
for a job you’d never accept anyway. This approach may prevent you
from getting some job offers, but they aren’t jobs that you want
anyway. One advantage to expressing exactly what you want to do is
that even if you don’t begin the day interviewing with an interesting
group, you may end the day interviewing with such a group.
</p>

<p>
One final note on answering this question: It’s a good opportunity to
mention that you want to work with a great team - don’t pass it up.
Make sure that being a member of a great team comes across as one of
your priorities.

requiring long hours in cramped conditions or a larger company that’s
just beginning a new project. Or perhaps they’re fervent believers in
the two-person team programming model. In any case, know what your

specific achievements and be enthusiastic as you talk about your

but also about what you learned. Talk about what went right, but also
what went wrong. Describe positive and negative experiences and what

This question gives you a chance to explain why you want this job
(apart from the money) and how you see it fitting into your overall
career. This is similar to the question about what you want to do. The
employer is concerned that you may not want to do the job. In this
case, it is because the job may not fit into your career goals. It’s
certainly okay to be confused about what you want to do - many people
are. Try to have at least a general idea of where you see yourself
going. Your answer might be as simple as, “I’m hoping to work in
development for a while and work on some great projects. Then, I’m
looking to go into project management. Beyond that, it’s hard to say.”
This answer shows motivation and convinces the employer that you’ll
succeed on the job.

<div id="outline-container-sec-15-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-15-5">“Why Are You Looking to Change Jobs?”</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-5">
<p>
Interviewers generally want to know what you don’t like to do.
Clearly, you don’t like your last job or you would probably still be
there. In addition, there’s a fear that you may be trying to cover a
weakness that caused you to leave your last job. Therefore, try to
answer this question by citing either a change in environment, a
factor out of your control, or a weakness that the interviewer already
knows. For example, to cite a change in environment you could say,
“I’ve worked in a large company for five years and experienced the
software development process for a mature product. I no longer want to
be a number in a large company. I want to join a start-up and be a key
person from the ground up and watch something grow.” Or, you could
answer, “I worked at a start-up that didn’t have its act together. Now
I want to work at a company that does.”
</p>

<p>
To cite a factor out of your control, you could say, “My current
company has given up on the project I’ve been working on and they’re
trying to relocate me to something that I don’t find interesting.” Or,
you could respond, “My company was acquired and the whole atmosphere
has changed since then.”
</p>

<p>
It’s also generally acceptable to cite a weakness that the interviewer
already knows. You could say, “My last job required extensive
systems-level programming. I was way behind everyone else on that
topic, and I don’t find that sort of work very exciting. I’m much more
interested in doing Web programming, which I do have experience in.”
</p>

<p>
One final note: Even though money is often a good reason to change
jobs, be careful about citing it as a prime reason. This raises the
possibility that your current employer doesn’t offer you more money
because you’re not that valuable and you’re hoping someone else won’t
notice this fact.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-15-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-15-6">“How Much Money Do You Want to Make?”</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-6">
<p>
This question may appear in any context. It’s most common, though,
either at the initial screening or when the company has decided to
make you an offer. If it’s asked at the beginning, the employer may
want to know if it’s even worth talking to you, given your salary
expectations, or the employer may genuinely have no idea what the
position should pay. It is generally considered wise to put this
question off as long as possible. It is not in your interest to
discuss numbers until you’ve convinced the potential employer of your
value. If you can’t escape this question in the early stages of an
interview, try to give a range of salaries with the amount that you
want at the low end. This gives you good bargaining room later.
</p>

<p>
If you’re asked the question near the end of the process, this can
only indicate good things. If the interviewer has no interest in
hiring you at this point, he won’t bother asking this question.
Generally, larger companies have less latitude in compensation
packages than smaller companies. If you’re asked this question, it
probably indicates the company is willing to negotiate. It’s important
to realize companies are often unaware of how to make a competitive
offer. This is your chance to tell them how to do exactly that.
</p>

<p>
First, it’s important to do your homework ahead of time when answering
this question. If you find that people with similar jobs in your area
are making $40,000–$55,000 a year, you’re probably not going to make
$80,000 a year. Second, never undersell yourself. If you’re looking
for an annual salary of $70,000, don’t tell an employer that you’re
looking for around $60,000 a year with the hope that the employer
will, for some reason, offer more. This response makes it almost
impossible for the employer to make a good offer. Third, consider
carefully what you want in a total compensation package. You may be
graduating from college and want a signing bonus to offset the costs
of finding an apartment, moving, and placing deposits. Or, you may be
looking to join a start-up offering generous stock options and
slightly lower salaries. In any case, it’s important to figure out
exactly what you’re looking for in terms of bonuses, benefits, stock
options, and salary.
</p>

<p>
In general, try not to tip your hand too early when answering this
question. The person with more information generally does better in a
negotiation. Instead of answering a question about salary directly,
ask what range the interviewer is prepared to offer. There are four
possible answers to your question.
</p>

<p>
First, the range may be about what you expected. In this case, you can
usually gain a slightly higher salary by following these rules: First,
try not to act too excited - stay cool. Next, say that you had a
similar but slightly higher range in mind, setting your minimum at the
maximum of the offered range. For example, if the employer says,
“We’re expecting to pay $40,000 to $45,000,” you should respond, “That
seems about right. I’m looking to make $45,000 to $50,000 and hoping
for the high end of that range.” Finally, negotiate in a professional
manner until you agree on a number with the interviewer; you’ll
probably receive an offer between $43,000 and $48,000.
</p>

<p>
The second possibility is that the negotiator starts with a range
higher than you expected. This is great!
</p>

<p>
In the third case, the negotiator may not answer your question. He or
she may give a response like “We have a wide range of salaries
depending on the applicant. What were you expecting?” This response is
actually quite favorable because it indicates that he or she probably
has the authority to pay you a competitive salary. The response shows
that the negotiator is willing to negotiate, but it also indicates
that you may be subject to some hardball negotiating skills. Bearing
in mind that negotiation will follow, respond with one number, the
high end of your range. This gives you room to negotiate and still
receive a favorable offer. For example, if you’re expecting between
$55,000 and $60,000, say, “I’m expecting $60,000 a year.” Presenting
it like this leaves the other negotiator less room to lowball you than
if you give a range. Avoid weaker expressions like “I’m hoping for …”
or “I’d really like …” The negotiator may accept your number, or may
try to negotiate a slightly lower salary. If you remain professional
and negotiate carefully, your final salary should fall within your
desired range. Alternatively, the negotiator may respond by telling
you that the company has a substantially lower range in mind. In this
case, your response should be the same as in option four, which is
described next.
</p>

<p>
The fourth option is that the offer may be less than you expected. In
these cases, here are some tactics to try to increase the offer.
First, re-emphasize your skills and state the salary range you were
expecting. For example, if you were offered a salary of $35,000 but
were expecting $50,000, you may say, “I have to admit I’m a little
disappointed with that offer. Given my extensive experience with Web
development and the contributions I can make to this company, I’m
expecting a salary of $50,000.” The negotiator may need time to get
back to you, which is perfectly fine. If the negotiator doesn’t
increase the offer after hearing your range, he or she will often cite
one of the following three reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>That amount wasn’t budgeted.
</li>
<li>Similar employees at the company don’t make that much.
</li>
<li>Your experience doesn’t warrant such a salary.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
None of these is an acceptable reason. First, the budget may be a
constraint on the company, but it shouldn’t be a constraint on your
salary. If the company really wants you, it will find the money and a
way around this artificial barrier. If the company truly can’t find
the money, it’s such a cash-strapped, close-to-death organization that
you probably don’t want to work there anyway.
</p>

<p>
Second, it doesn’t matter what the company pays other employees.
That’s between the company and those employees. Other employees
shouldn’t determine your compensation. You can respond by saying, “I
wasn’t aware that my compensation would be tied to other employees’
compensations. I’m looking for a package that is commensurate with my
skills of X and believe that $Y is such a package.”
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you’ve done your homework, you know your experience and
skills do warrant such a salary and the company is trying to lowball
you. Simply re-emphasize your skills and explain that, after doing
your research, you know your desired salary is indeed the competitive
market salary. The company may realize it is out of touch with the
market and increase its offer.
</p>

<p>
If the negotiator does not increase the offer but you still want the
job, you have two last-ditch tactics. First, you can say that you’re
tempted to take the job, but that you’d like a salary review in six
months to discuss your performance and compensation. You generally
have a much stronger hand before you join a company, so you shouldn’t
expect miracles. Most negotiators, however, will grant this request.
Make sure you get it in writing if you go this route. Second, try to
negotiate other parts of the package. For example, you may be able to
get additional vacation days, flex hours, or a sign-on bonus.

Here are a few final thoughts on the salary issue. Some people are
embarrassed or shy about talking about salary. You should realize that
you’re already looking to engage in a business relationship, and
salary is just one more part of the picture. No employer expects you
to work for free, and there’s no reason you should act as if
compensation isn’t important.
</p>

<p>
Many negotiators will cite factors such as benefits or work style to
draw you to a company. These factors may be important reasons to join
a company, and you’d certainly want all of the benefits spelled out.
These perks, though, are generally not negotiable. Don’t bother
discussing non-negotiable factors in a negotiation, and don’t get
sidetracked if your negotiator mentions them.

This question is obnoxious, rude, and belittling. It implies that
there’s no obvious reason why you’re qualified for the job. Clearly,
you have skills and experience that make you qualified; otherwise, the
interviewer wouldn’t be talking to you. In these instances, avoid
becoming defensive and reciting your résumé to list your
qualifications. Instead, keep things positive by talking about why you
want to work at the company and why the job is a good match for your
skills. This response shows you can handle criticism and may deflect
your interviewer.

Conventional wisdom has always said to ask a question because it shows
enthusiasm. Nothing spoils a good interview, though, like asking a
stupid question right at the end. Asking a contrived question just
because you feel you should won’t count in your favor. A thoughtful
and articulate question can tell you a lot about the company and
impress your interviewer. Often, your interviewer doesn’t tell you
what he or she does. This is a good time to ask. It lets you know more
about what you would potentially be doing and shows genuine interest
in the person. In addition, if the interviewer mentioned anything
during the interview that sounded interesting, ask for more detail
about it. This can yield further insight into your potential future
employer. Finally, if you don’t have questions, you can make a joke of
it. You could say, “Gee, I know that I’m supposed to ask a question,
but the people I interviewed with this morning answered all my
questions. I guess you’re off the hook!”
