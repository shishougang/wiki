  They developed the Dreyfus Model of skill acquisition,1 which out-
lines five discrete stages through which one must pass on the jour-
ney from novice to expert.
</p>

<p>
Their research showed that quite a bit changes as you move from
novice to expert. You don’t just “know more,” or gain skill. Instead,
you experience fundamental differences in how you perceive the
world, how you approach problem-solving, and the mental models
you form and use. How you go about acquiring new skills changes.
External factors that help your performance—or hinder it—change
as well.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stage 1: Novices
Rules can only get you started, they won’t carry you further.
</li>
<li>Stage 2: Advanced Beginners
</li>
<li>Stage 3: Competent
</li>
<li>Stage 4: Proficient
Proficient practitioners need the big picture. They will seek out
and want to understand the larger conceptual framework around this
skill. They will be very frustrated by oversimplified information.

<p>
But proficient practitioners make a major breakthrough on the
Dreyfus model: they can correct previous poor task performance. They
can reflect on how they’ve done, and revise their approach to
perform better the next time. Up until this stage, that sort of
self-improvement is simply not available.
</p>
</li>
<li>Stage 5: Expert
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The journey from novice to expert involves more than just rules and
intuition, of course. There are many characteristics that change as
you move up the skill level. But the three most important changes
along the way are:10
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Moving away from reliance on abstract principles to past
experience.
</li>
<li>A change in perception, where a problem is no longer a collection
of equally relevant bits, but a complete and unique whole where
only certain bits are relevant.
</li>
<li>Finally, a change from being a detached observer of the problem to
an involved part of the system itself.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
And hard work it is—merely working at a subject for ten years isn’t
enough. You need to practice. Deliberate practice, according to noted
cognitive scientist Dr. K. Anderson Ericsson, requires four
conditions:
</p>

<p>
• well-defined task
• appropriate difficulty
• informative feedback
• opportunities for repetition and correction of errors.
</p>

<p>
Do that sort of practice, steadily, for ten years, and you’ve got it
made. 
</p>

<p>
outlines some of the dangers of over-reliance on formal models 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Confusing the model with reality
</li>
<li>Devaluing traits that cannot be formalized
</li>
<li>Legislating behavior that contradicts individual autonomy
</li>
<li>Alienating experienced practitioners in favor of novices
</li>
<li>Spelling out too much detail
</li>
<li>Oversimplification of complex situations
</li>
<li>Demand for excessive conformity
</li>
<li>Insensitivity to contextual nuances
</li>
<li>Confusion between following rules and exercising judgement
</li>
<li>Mystification

For instance, have you ever had the experience of trying to describe
a dream when you first wake up? Many times it seems that a crystal
clear, vivid dream evaporates from your memory as soon as you
try to describe it in words. That’s because the images, feelings, and
overall experience are R-mode things: your dream was generated in
R-mode. As you try to put your dream into words, you experience a sort
of bus contention. L-mode takes over the bus, and now you can’t get
at those memories any more. In effect, they aren’t verbalizable.
</p>

<p>
Have you ever had the solution to a vexing problem (a bug, a design
problem, the name of a long-forgotten band) come to you while
you’re in the shower? Or sometime the next day, when you aren’t
thinking about it? That’s because R-mode is asynchronous. It’s off
as a background process, churning through old inputs, trying to
dig up the information you need. And there’s a lot for it to look
through.
</p>

<p>
And you might already be reaching for synthetic learning more
often than you think. When faced with a difficult design problem, or
an elusive bug, good programmers generally have an urge to reach
for code, and build something that they can learn from. That’s R-
mode synthesis, as opposed to the L-mode based analysis. That’s
why we like prototypes, and independent unit tests. These give us
the opportunity to learn by synthesis—by building.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it can. In fact, additional studies have shown exactly that:
positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking.
Being “happy” broadens your thought processes, and brings more
of the brain’s hardware online.
</p>

<p>
The converse has been well-established. When you are fearful or
angry—filled with negative emotions—your brains starts shutting
down extra resources in preparation for the inevitable fight or
flight. We’ll look at that side of the reaction in the (as yet) unwritten
TryingTooHard. For now, just remember that aesthetics make a
difference, whether it’s in a user interface, the layout of your code
and comments, choices of variable names, arrangement of your
desk top, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
“Metaphor, a common ground for both verbalizations and images, is a
way to voyage back and forth between the subconscious and conscious,
between right and left hemispheres.”
</p>

<p>
The use of metaphor is a powerful technique to open up creativity.
</p>

<p>
This notion of combining two different, incompatible ideas is the
very definition of creativity according to researcher/philosopher
Arthur Koestler. In his model, some particular topic area forms
a particular frame of reference. The sudden switch from one selfconsistent
frame of reference to a different, unexpected, incompatible
frame of reference is the basis of a strong metaphor. That
junction of the two different frames is called a bisociation.
</p>

<p>
I was talking to Kent Beck, the father of XP, about metaphors in
general and he said:
</p>

<p>
“Metaphorical thinking is fundamental in programming, as it is
in all abstract thought. When we aren’t aware of our metaphors
we can lead ourselves astray. Mixing metaphors negates much of
their power. Why do we override a method in a subclass? Clear
metaphors make it easier to learn, reason about, and extend code.”
</p>

<p>
Humor is neither a waste of time nor a harmless diversion; instead,
it reflects an important ability necessary for thinking, learning, and
creativity.
</p>

<p>
In either case, the talent for humor comes from drawing or extending
relationships beyond the norm, truly seeing “out of the box.”
A quick wit—being able to draw connections between things that
aren’t related, or to extend an idea past it’s breaking point—is a
skill well worth practicing and honing, and encouraging in your
team.
</p>

<p>
For more in-depth exploration, try playing with WordNet,
available from <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu">http://wordnet.princeton.edu</a> for all major platforms.
This gives you not only synonyms, but also antonyms,
hypernyms, hyponyms, and other derivations of various flavors.
</p>

<p>
Skills and abilities that you constantly use and constantly practice
will begin to dominate, and more of your brain will become wired
for those purposes.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, lesser-used skills will lose ground. “Use it or lose
it” is perfectly accurate in this case, as your brain will dedicate
more resources to whatever you are doing the most.

<p>
Drawing is an R-mode activity.
</p>

<p>
First of all, drawing really isn’t about making marks on
paper. Anyone with normal physical abilities can put the appropriate
marks on paper as required for drawing and sketching. The
hard part isn’t the drawing end, it’s the seeing. And this sort of
visual perception is very much an R-mode task.
</p>

<p>
So it was Dr. Edwards who first suggested that to get at the real
perception, you need to shut down the L-mode and let the R-mode
do the task for which it is best suited. To accomplish this, she
recommends an exercise similar to the following to help you experience
a cognitive shift:
</p>

<p>
• Allow 30-40 minutes of quiet, uninterrupted time
• Copy a simple image like the one shown Figure 4.2, on page 77
• DO NOT re-orient the page
• DO NOT name any parts you recognize
• Just say to yourself up, over, this goes that way a little bit, and
so on
</p>

<p>
Why does this work?
</p>

<p>
It works because you’ve given your L-mode a job it doesn’t want. By
consistently refusing to name the parts you see, the L-mode finally
gives up. This isn’t a task it can handle, so it gets out of the way,
and lets the R-mode processing handle it instead—which is exactly
what you want.
</p>

<p>
That’s the whole point of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. It’s
all about using the correct tool for the job.
</p>

<p>
How did you feel during this exercise? Did it feel “different”? Did
you get a sense of losing track of time, and being immersed in
flow? Did the drawing turn out better than had you tried to just
copy it normally?
</p>

<p>
Dr. David Galin is a noted researcher at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric
Institute, University of California at San Francisco. He believes that
teachers these days have three main responsibilities to the whole student:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Train both hemispheres. not only the verbal, symbolic, logical left
mode (as is traditional), but also the spatial, relational,
holistic right mode.
</li>
<li>Train students to use the cognitive style suited to the task at hand.
</li>
<li>Train students to bring both styles to bear on a problem in an
integrated manner.

<p>
<b>Pair Programming</b>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One of the more effective—and controversial—practices espoused
by Extreme Programming is pair programming. In Pair Programming,
you have two programmers working at a single keyboard and
monitor. One person types code in the IDE (the driver) while the
other (the navigator) sits back and offerssuggestions, advice, and
kibitzes in general.
</p>

<p>
One reason this might work so well is that while the driver is locked
in verbal mode at a particular level of detail, the navigator is free to
engage more non-verbal (right side) centers.
</p>

<p>
When you talk to another person, or work hand in hand with someone
at a whiteboard or a paper, your thinking tends to get more
abstract. You are more likely to discover new abstract patterns,
which is what all of us programmers are trying to achieve.
</p>


<p>
Image streaming is a technique designed to help harvest R-mode
imagery. The basic idea is to deliberately observe mental imagery:
pay close attention to it and work it around in your mind a bit.
</p>

<p>
First, pose yourself a problem or ask yourself a question. Then
close your eyes, maybe put your feet up on the desk (this is perfect
for doing at work) for about ten minutes or so.
</p>

<p>
For each image that crosses your mind:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Look at the image and try to see all the details you can
</li>
<li>Describe it out loud (really use your voice; it makes a difference.
Now you’re sitting with feet up on the desk and talking to yourself)
</li>
<li>Imagine the image using all five senses (or as many as practical)
</li>
<li>Use present tense, even if the image was fleeting

<p>
<b>Morning Pages</b>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here are the rules:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write your morning pages first thing in the morning. Before coffee,
before the traffic report, before talking to Mr. Showerhead, before
packing the kids off to school or letting the dog out.
</li>
<li>Write at least 3 pages, long hand. No typing, no computer.
</li>
<li>Do not censor what you write. Whether it’s brilliant or banal, just let it out.
</li>
<li>Do not skip a day.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It’s okay if you don’t know what to write. One executive taking this
program loudly proclaimed that this exercise was a complete waste
of time. He defiantly wrote three pages of “I don’t know what to
write. Blah blah blah.” And that’s fine.
</p>

<p>
Because after a while, he noticed other stuff started appearing in
his morning pages. Marketing plans. Product directions. Solutions.
Germs of innovative ideas. He overcame his initial resistance to the
idea, and found it to be a very effective technique for harvesting
thoughts.

Why does this work? I think it’s because you’re getting an
unguarded brain dump. First thing in the morning, you’re not
really as awake as you think. Your unconscious still has a prominent
role to play. You haven’t yet raised all the defenses and
adapted to the limited world of reality. You’ve got a pretty good
line direct to your R-mode, at least for a little while.

We’ll look at four broad categories of problems:
• Cognitive biases: How your thinking can be led astray
• Generational affinity: How your peers influence you
• Personality tendencies: How your personality influences your thoughts
• Hardware bugs: How older portions of your brain can override the
  smarter portions

 <b>Defer Closure</b>
That means you’ll be at your peak of intelligence at the very end of
the project and at your most ignorant at the very beginning. So, do
you want to make decisions early on? No; you want to defer closure
for as long as possible in order to make a better decision later. But
that means critical issues may stay unsettled for a long time, which
makes many people acutely uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Resist the pressure. Know that you will reach a decision, and the
matter will be settled, just not today.
</p>

<p>
Agile software development embraces the idea of working with
uncertainty. Early on, you don’t know what the project end date
will really be. You’re not 100 percent certain which features will be
present in the next iteration. You don’t know how many iterations
there will be. And that’s perfectly OK: that’s the sort of uncertainty
you want to be comfortable with. You’ll find answers as you go
along, and by the end, everything will have been answered.
</p>

<p>
You can, of course, take some concrete steps to try to reduce uncertainty.
You might talk the matter over with peers, google around
for more information, or build a prototype—that sort of thing. But
although these steps might help a little or a lot, they’re not a cure.
There will always be elements that are just plain uncertain, and
that’s not a bad thing. Chip away at it, but don’t be in a rush to
nail down details if it’s not ready yet. Be comfortable with the fact
you don’t know.
